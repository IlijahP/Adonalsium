<p class="tni">Venli felt all rhythms freeze when she saw Rlain in the cell. Like the silence following a crescendo.</p>
<p class="fmtx">In that silence, Venli finally believed what Mazish had told her. In that silence, all of Roshar changed. Venli was no longer the last. And in that silence, Venli thought she could hear something distant beyond the rhythms. A pure tone.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain looked up through the bars, then sneered at her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The moment of peace vanished. He’d picked up some human expressions, it seemed. Did he recognize her in this form? Her skin patterns were the same, but she and Rlain had never been close. He likely saw only an unfamiliar Regal.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli retreated down the hallway, passing several empty cells with bars on the doors. It was the day after the incident with Stormblessed and the destruction of the node. Venli had been on her way to visit Rlain when the event had occurred, drawing her away to attend her master.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Curiously, though Venli had assumed that Raboniel would be furious, instead she’d taken it in stride. She’d almost seemed <i class="calibre6">amused</i> at what had occurred. She was hiding something about her motivations. She seemed to not <i class="calibre6">want</i> the corruption to happen too quickly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">At any rate, dealing with the aftermath of the incident had involved Venli interpreting late into the night for various Fused. It hadn’t been until <span aria-label="718" id="pg_718" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>this morning that she’d been able to break away and come check on what Mazish had told her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain. Alive.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Near the door, Venli met with the head jailer: a direform Regal with a crest of spikes beginning on his head and running down his neck.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I didn’t realize we <i class="calibre6">had</i> a prison,” she said to him—softly, and to Indifference.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The humans built it,” he replied, also to Indifference. “I interviewed several of the workers here. They claim they were keeping the assassin in here.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“<i class="calibre6">The</i> assassin?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Indeed. He vanished right before we arrived.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He should have fallen unconscious.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Well, he didn’t, and nobody has seen anything of him.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You should have told me of this earlier,” Venli said. “The Lady thinks that certain Radiants might still be able to function in the tower. It’s possible this one is out there somewhere, preparing to kill.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The direform hummed to Abashment. “Well, we’ve been prepping this place in case we need to lock up a Regal with proper comforts. We’ve got a larger brig for human prisoners. Figured this would be a good place for your friend there, until official word arrived.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli glanced along the hall of empty cells, lit by topaz lanterns hanging from the ceiling. They gave the chamber a soft brown warmth, the color of cremstone.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Why did you lock him away?” she asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He’s an essai,” the direform said to Derision, using an ancient word they’d picked up from the Fused. It meant something along the lines of “human lover,” though her form told her it technically meant “hairy.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He was a spy my people sent to watch them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Then he betrayed you,” the direform said. “He claims he’d been held by the humans against his will, but it didn’t take much asking around to find the truth. He was friendly with the Radiants—was their servant or something. Could have left at any time, but stayed. Wanted to keep being a slave, I guess.” He changed to the Rhythm of Executions—a rarely used rhythm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will speak with him,” Venli said. “Alone.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The direform studied her, humming to Destruction in challenge. She hummed it back—she outranked this one, so long as she was Raboniel’s Voice.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will send again to the Lady of Wishes,” he finally said, “to inform her that you have done this.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“As you will,” Venli said, then waited pointedly until he stepped out and shut the door. Venli glanced into Shadesmar, as she’d grown into the habit of doing, though she’d learned Voidspren couldn’t hide in the tower. It was instinct by now. And she—</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="719" id="pg_719" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">Wait.</i> There <i class="calibre6">was</i> a Voidspren here.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was hiding in the body of a cremling. Most spren could enter bodies, if they couldn’t pass through other solid objects. She wasn’t terribly familiar with all the varieties of Voidspren, but this one must have realized that it couldn’t hide in the tower as it once had, so used this method to remain unseen.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She attuned Anxiety, and Timbre agreed. Was it watching her, or Rlain? Or was it simply here to patrol? Had she done anything recently that would give her away?</p>
<p class="fmtx">She maintained her composure, pretending to think as she strolled in the prison chamber. Then she pretended to notice the cremling for the first time, then shooed it away. The thing scuttled down the wall and out under the door. She glanced into Shadesmar, and saw the Voidspren—through the hundreds of shimmering colors that made up the tower—retreating into the distance alongside the tiny speck of light that represented the cremling.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That left her nervous enough that she paced a few times—and checked again—before finally she forced herself to return to the cell. “<i class="calibre6">Rlain.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He looked up at her. Then he frowned and stood.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s me,” she said to Peace, speaking in the listener language for an extra measure of privacy. “Venli.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He stepped closer to the bars, and his eyes flickered to her face. He hummed to Remembrance. “I was under the impression they had killed all of the listeners.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Only most of us. What are you <i class="calibre6">doing</i> here, Rlain? Last we knew, the humans had discovered you in the warcamps and executed you!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I … wasn’t discovered,” he said. He spoke to Curiosity, but his body language—he had indeed picked up some human attitudes—betrayed his true emotions. He obviously didn’t trust her. “I was made an example, used as an experiment. They put me in the bridge crews. I don’t think anyone ever suspected I was a spy. They just thought I was too smart for a parshman.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’ve been living among them all this time? That guard says you’re an ess—a human sympathizer. I can’t believe you’re alive, and I’m not the … I mean…” Language failed her, and she ended up standing there, humming the Rhythm of the Lost and feeling like an idiot. Timbre chimed in, giving the same rhythm—and that helped somehow.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain studied her. He’d probably heard that forms of power changed a person’s personality—storms … they’d always known that. Known they were dangerous.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Rlain,” she said, her voice soft, “I’m me. <i class="calibre6">Truly</i> me. This form doesn’t … change me like stormform did for the others.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre pulsed. Tell him the truth. Show him what you are.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="720" id="pg_720" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She locked up. <i class="calibre6">No.</i> She couldn’t.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The others?” he asked, hopeful. “Remala? Eshonai? She fought Adolin, we think, in battle. Do you know … if she is…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I saw my sister’s corpse myself at the bottom of the chasms,” she said to Pain. “There aren’t any others left but me. He … Odium took them, made them into Fused. He saved me because he wanted me to tell stories about our people, use them to inspire the newly freed singers. But I think he was afraid of us, as a group. So he destroyed us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She hummed to the Rhythm of the Lost again. Rlain eventually joined her and stepped forward until he was right beside the bars.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m sorry, Venli,” he eventually said. “That must have been awful.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">He doesn’t know,</i> she realized, <i class="calibre6">that I caused all this. How could he? He was among the humans. To him, I’m simply … another survivor.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">She found that idea daunting.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You need to free me,” Rlain said. “I hoped they’d accept my story, but I’m too well known in the tower. You stand out when you’re the only ‘parshman’ anyone knows.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ll see what I can do,” Venli said to Reconciliation. “The guard doesn’t trust me—a lot of them don’t—and talking to you will make that worse. If I do get you out, what are you going to do? You won’t get me into trouble, will you?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He frowned at her, then hummed to Irritation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You <i class="calibre6">are</i> a human sympathizer,” Venli said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They’re my friends,” he said. “My family, now. They aren’t perfect, Venli, but if we want to defeat Odium we’re going to need them. We’re going to need this tower.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Do we want to defeat Odium?” Venli asked. “A lot of people like the way things are going, Rlain. We have a nation of our own—not a few shacks in a backwater countryside, but a <i class="calibre6">real</i> nation with cities, roads, infrastructure. Things—I might add—that were largely built by the efforts of enslaved singers. The humans don’t deserve our loyalty or even an alliance. Not after what they did.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain didn’t object immediately. Instead he hummed to Tension. “We find ourselves caught, literally, between two storms,” he finally said. “But if I’m going to pick one to walk through, Venli, I’ll pick the highstorm. That was once our storm. The spren were our allies. And yes, the humans tried to exploit the listeners, then tried to destroy us—but the Fused are the ones who <i class="calibre6">succeeded.</i> Odium chose to destroy our people. I’m not going to serve him. I…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He trailed off, perhaps realizing what he was saying. He’d tried to start the conversation noncommittal, plainly worried she was an agent for <span aria-label="721" id="pg_721" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Odium. Now he’d confirmed where he stood. He looked to her, and his humming fell silent. Waiting.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t know if any good can be done by fighting him, Rlain,” she whispered. “But I … keep secrets from Odium myself. I’ve been trying to build something separate from his rule, a people I could … I don’t know, use to start a new group of listeners.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Trying, in her own pitiful way, to undo what she’d done.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How many?” Rlain asked, to Excitement.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A dozen so far,” Venli said. “I have them watching over the fallen Radiants. I have some authority in the tower, but I don’t know how far it will extend. It’s complicated. The various Fused have different motivations, and I’m wrapped up in the threads of it all. I helped save some humans who were going to be executed—but I’m not interested in allying with them in general.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Who did you save? The queen?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No, someone far less important,” Venli said. “A surgeon and his wife, who were—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Lirin and Hesina?” he asked to Excitement. “The child too, I hope.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes. How did you—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You <i class="calibre6">need</i> to get me <i class="calibre6">out,</i> Venli,” Rlain said. “And get me to Hesina. I have something useful I could show her—and you, if you want to help.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ve been trying to tell you,” Venli whispered, glancing over her shoulder at the door. “I have <i class="calibre6">some</i> authority, but there are many who distrust me. I don’t know if I can get you free. It might draw too much attention to me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Venli,” he said to Confidence, “look at me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She met his gaze. Had he always been this intense? Eshonai had known him better than she had.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You need to do this,” Rlain said to her. “You need to use whatever influence you have and <i class="calibre6">get me out.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t know if—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Stop being so insufferably selfish! Do something <i class="calibre6">against</i> your own self-interest, for the greater good, for once in your <i class="calibre6">storming</i> life, Venli.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She hummed to Betrayal. She didn’t deserve that. She’d just told him how she was trying to rebuild the listeners. But he hummed louder to Confidence, so she aligned her rhythm to his.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ll try,” she said.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Though Raboniel often spent her time down near the crystal pillar—or with the human scholars in the chambers nearby—the Lady of Wishes had <span aria-label="722" id="pg_722" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>indicated she would be about other duties today. By asking around, Venli found that she was for some reason at the Blackthorn’s former rooms.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli stepped inside, where an unusual number of Fused had gathered and were systematically going through the warlord’s belongings—cataloguing them, making notations about them, and packing them away. Venli passed through and saw one crate contained socks: each pair recorded and carefully stored.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They were putting all of his things into storage, but why had they dedicated Fused to such a mundane job? What was more, these were important Fused, none of the more erratic or crazy represented. Leshwi herself had been pressed into the work, and that all together whispered something meaningful: Someone very high up in the singer hierarchy was interested in this man. To the point of wanting to dissect and understand his each and every possession, no matter how ordinary.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli moved around the perimeter of the room, careful to stay away from the broad doors or windows leading to the balcony. Those had been draped off, but the rules were strict during daylight hours. No singers were to show themselves outside, lest they accidentally reveal the truth to Windrunner scouts.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She found two humans she didn’t recognize at the doorway into the bedroom, watching what occurred inside. There, Raboniel was speaking to a third human. The tall male was dressed in a coat and trousers that seemed elegant to Venli’s eyes—though she knew little of their fashion. More striking was the strange creature on his shoulder, an odd thing unlike any Venli had ever seen. It stood on two legs like a person, though its face ended in a beak and it had brightly colored scales that looked <i class="calibre6">soft,</i> of all things. When she entered, it turned and stared at her, and she was unnerved by how bright and intelligent its eyes seemed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Lady of Wishes sat in a chair by the bed, her face passive, with stacks of papers and books beside her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Who was this man, and why would Raboniel pause her research to give him an audience? The Lady normally ignored requests from humans, going so far as to have several “important” ones flogged when they demanded audiences. More curious, as Venli edged around the side of the room, she saw that the man’s face was scarred in several places, bespeaking a roughness in contrast to his fine clothing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The only thing I find remarkable,” Raboniel said to Derision, “is how audacious you are, human. Do you not understand how easily I could have you beaten or killed?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That would be to throw away a useful opportunity,” the man said, loud and bold—a human version of the Rhythm of Determination. “And <span aria-label="723" id="pg_723" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>you are not one who throws away something useful, are you, Ancient One?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Use is relative,” Raboniel replied. “I will throw away an opportunity I’ll never have time to exploit if it is preventing me from something better.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What is better than free riches?” he said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have Urithiru,” she said. “What need have I of spheres?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not that kind of riches,” the man said, with a smile. He stepped forward and respectfully handed her a large pouch. Raboniel took it, and it made a soft clink. Raboniel undid the top, and stared inside. She sat there for a long moment, and when she next spoke, her voice was <i class="calibre6">devoid</i> of rhythms. “How? Where did you get this?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I bring a gift,” was all the man said. “To encourage you to meet with my <i class="calibre6">babsk</i> to negotiate terms. I had thought to wait until the current … turmoil subsided, but my <i class="calibre6">babsk</i> is determined. We will have a deal for use of the Oathgates. And we will pay.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It is … a fine gift,” Raboniel finally said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That is not the gift,” he said. “That is a mere advance on our future payments. This is the gift.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He gestured to the side, and the strange creature on his shoulder whistled. The two men that Venli had seen outside entered, carrying something between them—a large cloth-covered box. It barely fit through the door, and was heavy, judging by the <i class="calibre6">thump</i> it made when they set it down.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The lead human whipped the cloth off, revealing a small teenage human girl in a box with bars on the sides. The dirty creature growled as she huddled in the center, shadowed. The man gestured dramatically, then bowed and began to walk away.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Human?” Raboniel said. “I did not dismiss you. What is this? I need no slaves.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This is no slave,” the man said. “But if your master does happen to ever locate Cultivation, suggest that he ask her precisely <i class="calibre6">why</i> she made an Edgedancer who is fueled by Lifelight and not Stormlight.” He bowed again—a formal military bow—then withdrew.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli waited, expecting Raboniel to demand he be executed, or at least flogged. Instead she started humming to Conceit. She even smiled.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I am confused, Ancient One,” Venli said, looking after the man.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You needn’t be,” Raboniel said, “for this has nothing to do with you. He <i class="calibre6">is</i> dramatic, as I was warned. Hopefully he thinks I was put onto the back foot by his little stunt. Did he <i class="calibre6">really</i> deliver me a Radiant who is awake despite the tower’s protections?” She peered in at the caged child, who stared back defiantly and growled. “Barely seems tame.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She clapped, and several servants entered. “Take this one to a secure <span aria-label="724" id="pg_724" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>place and do not let her go. Be careful. She might be dangerous.” As they took the cage, she turned to Venli and spoke to Craving. “So, was it really another of your people, as the reports say?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes,” Venli said. “I know him. His name is Rlain. A listener.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A child of traitors,” Raboniel said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“As am I,” Venli said, then paused. She took a deep breath and changed her rhythm to Conceit. “I would have him released to my care. I haven’t any other kin to speak of. He is precious to me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Odium specifically made your kin extinct,” Raboniel said. “You are the last. A distinction that you should appreciate, for the way it makes you unique.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I do not wish uniqueness,” Venli said. “I wish to keep this malen alive and enjoy his company. I have served well in several capacities, to multiple Fused. I demand this compensation.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel hummed to Derision. Venli panicked, and nearly lost her will—but Timbre, always watching, pulsed to <i class="calibre6">Conceit.</i> A rhythm of Odium, but the best counterpart to Resolve. The rhythm Venli needed to continue to express now. She did so, humming it, as she didn’t trust herself to speak.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Very well,” Raboniel said, picking up her papers to begin reading again. “Your Passion does you credit. He is yours. Be certain he doesn’t cause problems, for I will lay them at your charge.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli hummed to Tribute, then quickly retreated. Inside, Timbre pulsed to one of the normal rhythms. She seemed in pain, as if using one of the wrong rhythms had been hard for her. But they’d done it. Like she’d freed the Windrunner’s family.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre pulsed. Freedom. That was to be her next oath, Venli realized. To free those who had been taken unjustly. She almost said a new oath out loud, right there, but Timbre pulsed in warning.</p>
<p class="fmtx">So she returned to her rooms before going to Rlain. She shut the door to her quarters, then whispered the words.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will seek freedom for those in bondage,” she said, then waited. Nothing happened. Had it worked?</p>
<p class="fmtx">A distant sensation struck her, a femalen voice, so very far away—but thrumming with the pure rhythm of Roshar.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">These words,</i> it said, <i class="calibre6">are not accepted.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Not accepted? Venli sank down into a chair. Timbre pulsed to the Rhythm of Confusion. But in her gemheart, Venli realized she knew the reason. She’d just watched a child trapped in a cage be hauled off by Raboniel’s servants. It seemed obvious, now that she considered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She couldn’t honestly speak those words. Not when she was concerned with freeing Rlain primarily because she wanted another listener to con<span aria-label="725" id="pg_725" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>fide in. Not when she was willing to ignore the need of a child locked in a cage.</p>
<p class="fmtx">If she wanted to honestly progress as a Radiant, she’d need to do as Rlain had said and start thinking about someone other than herself. And it was beyond time for her to begin treating her powers with the respect they deserved.</p>
