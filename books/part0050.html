The ashspren’s lips momentarily blow away, exposing teeth in a sneer that vanishes when the blowing ash reincorporates. In the Physical Realm, ashspren appear as a crack that grows on a surface or branches through the air. When they move, they seem to burn through material, but leave the surface behind unmarred. We had few opportunities to examine ashspren closely, and they behaved in a hostile manner in every encounter. Most of them I only saw in passing." class="img1" id="fig7" src="../images/00025.jpeg" title="Shallan’s Sketchbook: Ashspren. This gesture was directed at us on more than one occasion.
