<p class="tni">“How could you not tell me this?” Radiant demanded as she knelt and shouted at the cube on the floor. “Restares is not only the honorspren’s High Judge, he’s one of the <i class="calibre6">storming</i> Heralds!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You didn’t require the information at that time,” Mraize’s voice said. “Be Veil. She will understand.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Veil is even <i class="calibre6">more</i> angry at you, Mraize,” Radiant said, standing up. “You sent us into a dangerous situation without proper preparation! Withholding this information wasted <i class="calibre6">weeks</i> while the three of us searched the fortress like an idiot.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We didn’t want you asking after a Herald,” Mraize said, his voice frustratingly calm. “That might have alerted him. So far as we’re aware, he hasn’t figured out that we know his true identity. Gavilar may have known, but no others in the Sons of Honor had an inkling that they served one of the very beings they were seeking—in their naive ignorance—to restore to Roshar. The irony is quite poetic.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Mmm…” Pattern said from beside the door, where he was watching for Adolin.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What?” Radiant asked him. “You like irony now too?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Irony tastes good. Like sausage.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And have you ever tasted sausage?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t believe I have a sense of taste,” Pattern said. “So irony tastes like what I imagine sausage would taste like when I’m imagining tastes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant rubbed her forehead, looking back at the cube. So unfair. She <span aria-label="928" id="pg_928" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>was accustomed to being able to stare down her troops, but one could not properly glare at a man who talked to you out of a box.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You told us we’d know what to do when we found Restares,” Radiant told Mraize. “Well, we are here now and we have <i class="calibre6">no</i> idea how to proceed.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What did you do the moment you found out?” Mraize said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Cursed your name.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Then?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Contacted you directly to curse at you some more.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Which was the correct choice. See, you knew exactly what to do.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant folded her arms, warm with anger. Frustration. And … admittedly … embarrassment. She bled into being Veil, and the anger returned.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The time has come,” she said, “for us to deal, Mraize.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Deal? The deal has already been set. You do as I have requested, and you will receive the offered reward—in addition to the practice and training you are receiving under my hand.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That is interesting,” Veil said. “Because I see this differently. I have come all this way, through great hardship. Because of Adolin’s sacrifice, I’ve gained access to one of the most remote fortresses on Roshar. I have succeeded where you explicitly told me your other agents have failed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Now that I’m here, instead of receiving ‘training’ or ‘practice’ as you say, I find that you’ve been withholding vital information from me. From my perspective, there is no incentive to continue this arrangement, as the promised reward is of little interest to me. Even Shallan is questioning its value.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your refusal to give me important information makes me question what else you held back. Now I’m questioning if what I’m to do here is possibly against my interests, and the interests of those I love. So let me ask plainly. Why am I really here? Why are you so interested in Kelek? And why—explicitly—should I continue on this path?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Mraize did not respond immediately. “Hello, Veil,” he finally said. “I’m glad you came out to speak with me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Answer my questions, Mraize.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“First, it is time to open the cube,” Mraize said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil frowned. “The communication cube? I thought you said that would ruin the thing.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“If you break into it, you <i class="calibre6">will</i> ruin it. Pick it up. Heft it. Listen for the side where my voice is weakest as I hum.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She knelt beside the cube again and picked it up, listening to Mraize’s humming voice. Yes … the sound was weaker from one direction.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ve found it,” she said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Good,” Mraize said. “Put your hand on that plane of the cube and twist it to the right.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="929" id="pg_929" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She felt it click as she touched it. She suspected Mraize had done something to unlock the device from wherever he was. When she twisted that plane of the cube, it turned easily and came off, revealing a small compartment that contained an intricate metal dagger with a gemstone on the end of the grip.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So you <i class="calibre6">do</i> want me to kill him,” she said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“One cannot kill a Herald,” Mraize said. “They are immortal. Do not think of Kelek as a person. He is an ageless, eternal spren formed of Honor’s substance and will. He is as gravity or light. Force, not man.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And you want me to stab that force with this knife,” Veil said, undoing the straps and prying it out from the cube. The cavity was only a small part of the hollow portion in the cube, and a layer of steel sectioned off the rest. Mraize’s voice came from the sealed portion. How had he weighted the cube such that she didn’t feel one end was heavier than the other?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I want you,” he said, “to collect the soul of Kelek, also known as Restares. The knife will trap his essence in that gemstone.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That seems overly cruel,” Veil said, looking over the knife.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Cruel like the spanreeds you so eagerly use, despite the spren trapped inside? It is no different. The being called Kelek is a receptacle of incredible knowledge. Gemstone imprisonment will not hurt him, and we will be able to communicate with him.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We have <i class="calibre6">two</i> other Heralds in the tower,” Veil said. “I could ask them anything you want to know.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You think they’d answer? How useful have they been, talking to Jasnah? Talenelat is completely insane, and Shalash is deceptively reticent. They talk of their Oathpact, yes, and fighting the Fused—but rarely reveal anything practical.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This isn’t very persuasive,” Veil said. “Yes, I know what you want me to do—but I suspected it from the beginning. If you want me to do this, I need to know <i class="calibre6">why.</i> What <i class="calibre6">specifically</i> do you expect to learn from him?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Our master, Thaidakar, has an … affliction similar to that of the Heralds. He needs access to a Herald to learn more about his state so he might save himself from the worst of its effects.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That’s not good enough,” Veil said. “Radiant and Shallan won’t let me do your dirty work for such a petty reason.” She put the dagger back in the cube. “I came here to report on Restares’s location. Shallan specifically told you we wouldn’t kill him—and yes, I count stabbing him with this device as the same thing.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Little knife,” Mraize said, his voice growing softer, “why did Sadeas need to die?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She hesitated, her hand still on the dagger, which she was trying to reattach to the straps in the cube.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This being,” Mraize continued, “that they call Kelek is a monster. <span aria-label="930" id="pg_930" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>He, along with the other eight, abandoned their Oathpact and stranded Talenelat—the Bearer of Agonies—alone in Damnation, to withstand torture for thousands of years. The enemy has returned, but have the Heralds come to help? No. At best they hide. At worst, their madness leads them to hasten the world’s destruction.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Kelek has become indecisive to the point of madness. And like most of them, he is afraid. He wants to escape his duties. He worked with Gavilar knowing full well that doing so would cause the return of the Fused and the end of our peace, because he hoped to find a way to escape this world. A way to abandon us as he had already abandoned his oaths and his friends.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He possesses knowledge essential to our fight against the invaders. However, he will not share it willingly. He hides himself away in the world’s most remote fortress and tries to pretend there is no war, that he is not culpable. He <i class="calibre6">is.</i> The only way to make him do his duty is to bring him back by force—and the best and easiest way to do that is to trap his soul.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Storms. That was a longer speech than she usually got out of Mraize. There was passion, conviction to his voice. Veil almost felt persuaded.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I can’t move against him,” she said. “He is set to judge Adolin in this trial. If Kelek vanished, that would throw all kinds of suspicion on us—and Adolin would most certainly be imprisoned. I can’t risk it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Hmm…” Mraize said. “If only there were a way that someone—having locked away Kelek’s soul—could take his place. Wear his face. Pass judgment, vindicating your husband and commanding the honorspren to join the war again. If <i class="calibre6">only</i> we had sent a person capable of single-handedly turning the tide of this war through the use of a targeted illusion.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">In that moment, Veil lost control to Shallan. Because what Mraize said here … it made too much sense.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Oh storms,</i> Shallan thought, growing cold. <i class="calibre6">Stormfather above and Nightwatcher below … He’s right. That is a solution to this problem. A way to let Adolin win. A way to bring the honorspren back.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">So this was how he manipulated her this time. She wanted to buck him for that reason alone. If only what he said weren’t so logical. It would be easy to replace Kelek, assuming she could get some Stormlight.…</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No,</i> Veil warned. <i class="calibre6">It’s not</i> that <i class="calibre6">easy. We’d have a difficult time impersonating a Herald.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We’d do the replacement at the last moment,</i> Shallan thought. <i class="calibre6">On the final day of the trial—to reduce the amount of time we need to pretend, and to give us a few days to scout out his personality.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Killing Sadeas saved thousands of lives,” Mraize continued in his soft, oily voice. “Delivering Kelek to us, sending the honorspren to bond Windrunners, could save <i class="calibre6">millions.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Veil isn’t certain we could imitate a Herald,” Shallan said.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="931" id="pg_931" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“The Herald is erratic,” Mraize said. “All of them are now. With a few pointers, you could escape notice. Honorspren are not good at noticing subterfuge—or at distinguishing what is odd behavior for humans, or those who were once human. You can accomplish this. And after the trial, ‘Kelek’ could insist he has to visit Urithiru himself, leaving the spren completely ignorant of what you’ve done.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It would be wrong, Mraize. It <i class="calibre6">feels</i> wrong.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Earlier, Veil demanded a deal. Though I normally reject this sort of talk, I find it encouraging that she did not demand money, or power. She wanted information, to know why she was doing what she did. You three are worthy hunters.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So I will revise the deal as requested. Perform as I ask here, and I will release you from your apprenticeship. You will become a full member of our organization—you will not only have access to the knowledge you seek, but also have a say in what we are doing. Our grand plans.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Inside, Veil perked up at this. But Shallan was surprised by how much <i class="calibre6">she</i> responded to that offer. A full Ghostblood? That was the way … The way to …</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Strike at a Herald,” she said. “It sounds wrong, Mraize. Very wrong.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You are weak,” he said. “You know it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She bowed her head.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“But part of you is not,” he continued. “A part that <i class="calibre6">can be</i> that strong. Let that side of you do what needs to be done. Save your husband, your kingdom, and your world all at once. Become that hunter, Shallan.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Become the knife.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">The honorspren surrounding the High Judge made room for Adolin as he approached, Blended following behind. He didn’t miss the glares that many of them gave her. No, there was no love lost between the two varieties of spren.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He should probably feel reverence for the High Judge. This was Kelek, though the spren called him Kalak for some reason. Either way, he was one of the Heralds—so Blended had explained. Many people back home thought of him as the Stormfather, and though that had never been true, he <i class="calibre6">was</i> one of the most ancient beings in all of creation. A god to many. An immortal soldier for justice and Honor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He was also short, with thinning hair. He felt like the type of man you’d find administering some minor city in the backwater of Alethkar. And if he was anything like Ash or Taln, the two Heralds who now resided at Urithiru …</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="932" id="pg_932" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Well, his acquaintance with those two caused Adolin to lower his expectations in this particular case.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kelek spoke with several honorspren leaders as they strolled up the lower portion of the western plane, entering a stone pathway made up of a multitude of colored cobblestones vaguely in the pattern of a gust of wind. The group paused as they saw Adolin ahead.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He removed his hand from his sword out of respect, then bowed to the Herald.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Hmm? A human?” Kelek said. “Why is he here? He looks dangerous, Sekeir.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He is,” said the honorspren beside Kelek. Sekeir was a leader of the fortress, and appeared as an ancient honorspren with a long blue-white beard. “This is Adolin Kholin, son of Dalinar Kholin.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The Bondsmith?” Kelek said, and <i class="calibre6">shied away</i> from Adolin. “Good heavens! Why have you let him in here?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have come, great one,” Adolin said, “to petition the honorspren for their aid in our current battle.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your current battle? Against Odium?” Kelek laughed. “Boy, you’re doomed. You realize that, right? Tanavast is <i class="calibre6">dead.</i> Like, completely dead. The Oathpact is broken somehow. The only thing left is to try to get off the ship before it sinks.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Holy Lord,” Sekeir said, “we let this one in because he offered to stand trial in the stead of the humans, for the pain they have caused our people.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re going to try him for the <i class="calibre6">Recreance</i>?” Kelek asked, looking around uncertainly at the others near him. “Isn’t that a bit extreme?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He offered, Holy Lord.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not a smart one, is he?” Kelek looked to Adolin, who hesitantly pulled up from his bow. “Huh. You’ve gotten yourself in deep, boy. They take this kind of thing <i class="calibre6">very</i> seriously around here.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I hope to show them, great one, that we are not their enemies. That the best course forward is for them to join us in our fight. It is, one might say, the <i class="calibre6">honorable</i> choice.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Honor is dead,” Kelek snapped. “Aren’t you paying attention? This world belongs to Odium now. He has his own storm, for heaven’s sake.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Blended nudged Adolin. Right. He was so distracted by Kelek that he’d forgotten the purpose of meeting with him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Great one,” Adolin said, “I’ve decided to petition for a trial by witness. Would you be willing to grant me this?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Trial by witness?” Kelek said. “Well, that would make this mess end faster. What do you think, Sekeir?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t think this would be a wise—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Hold on; I don’t care what you think,” Kelek said. “Here I am, years <span aria-label="933" id="pg_933" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>after joining you, and you <i class="calibre6">still</i> don’t have a way for me to get off this cursed world. Fine, boy, trial by witness it is. We can start it … um, the day after tomorrow? Is that acceptable for everyone?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">No one objected.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Great,” Kelek said. “Day after tomorrow. Okay then. Um … let’s have it at the forum, shall we? I guess everyone will want to watch, and that has the most seats.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Object to this,” Blended whispered to Adolin. “Do not let it be. You don’t want to have to persuade the audience as well as the judge.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Great one,” Adolin said, “I had hoped this to be an intimate, personal discussion of—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Tough,” Kelek said. “You should have thought of that before coming in here to create a storm. Everyone knows how this trial will end, so we might as well make a good time of it for them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin felt a sinking sensation as Kelek led the group of honorspren around him. Though few lighteyed judges were ever truly impartial, there was an expectation that they’d try to act with honor before the eyes of the Almighty. But this Herald basically told him the trial would be a sham. The man had made his judgment before hearing any arguments.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">How on Roshar was</i> that <i class="calibre6">ever considered a deity?</i> Adolin thought, in a daze. The Heralds had fallen so far.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Either that, or … perhaps these ten people had <i class="calibre6">always</i> been only that. People. After all, crowning a man a king or highprince didn’t necessarily make him anything grander than he’d been. Adolin knew that firsthand.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That could have gone better,” Blended said, “but at least a trial by witness is. Come. I have one day, it seems, to prepare you to be thrown into the angerspren’s den.…”</p>
