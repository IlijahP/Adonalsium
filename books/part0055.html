<p class="lti"><span aria-label="428" id="pg_428" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">We must assume that Odium has realized this, and is seeking a singular, terrible goal: the destruction—and somehow Splintering or otherwise making impotent—of all Shards other than him.</span></p>
<p class="tni">There was more than one way to protect.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin had always known this, but he hadn’t <i class="calibre6">felt</i> it. Feeling and knowing seemed to be the same to his father, but not to Kaladin. Listening to descriptions from books was never good enough for him. He had to try something to understand it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He threw himself into this new challenge: finding a way to help Noril and the others in the sanitarium. At his father’s recommendation—then insistence—Kaladin took it slowly, confining his initial efforts to men who shared similar symptoms. Battle fatigue, nightmares, persistent melancholy, suicidal tendencies.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin was correct, of course. Kaladin had complained that the ardents were treating all mental disorders the same; he couldn’t swoop in and treat each and every person in the entire sanitarium at once. First he needed to prove that he could make a difference for these few.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He still didn’t know how his father balanced work and emotion. Lirin genuinely seemed to care for his patients, but he could also turn it off. Stop thinking about the ones he couldn’t help. Such as the dozens of people trapped in the darkness of the sanitarium, locked away from the sun, moaning to themselves or—in one severe case—writing gibberish all over her room using her own feces.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Temporarily excused from seeing ordinary patients, Kaladin located six <span aria-label="429" id="pg_429" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>men in the sanitarium with similar symptoms. He released them and got them working to support each other. He developed a plan, and showed them how to share in ways that would help.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Today they sat in seats on the balcony outside his clinic. Warmed by mugs of tea, they talked. About their lives. The people they’d lost. The darkness.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It <i class="calibre6">was</i> helping. You didn’t need a surgeon or ardent to lead the discussion; they could do it themselves. Two of the six were mostly quiet, but even they grunted along when others talked about their problems.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Remarkable,” Kaladin’s mother said, taking notes as she stood with Kaladin to the side. “How did you know? Previous documentation indicated that they would feed each other’s melancholy, driving one another to destructive behavior. But these are having the <i class="calibre6">opposite</i> experience.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The squad is stronger than the individual,” Kaladin said. “You simply need to get them pointed in the right direction. Get them to lift the bridge together…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">His mother frowned, glancing up at him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The ardents’ stories about inmates feeding each other’s despair,” Kaladin said. “They probably came from inmates who were situated next to one another in the sanitariums. In dark places, where their gloom could run rampant … Yes, there I could see them driving each other closer toward death. It happens sometimes to … to slaves. In a hopeless situation, it’s easy to convince one another to give up.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">His mother rested her hand on his arm, and her face looked so sad he had to turn away. He didn’t like to talk to her about his past, the years between then and now. During those years she’d lost her loving boy, Kal. That child was dead, long ago buried in crem. At least by the time he’d found her again, Kaladin had become the man he was now. Broken, but mostly reforged as a Radiant.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She didn’t need to know about those darkest months. They would bring her nothing but pain.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Anyway,” Kaladin said, nodding toward the group of men, “I suspected after talking to Noril that this would help. It changes something to be able to speak to others about your pain. It helps to have others who <i class="calibre6">actually</i> understand.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I understand,” his mother said. “Your father understands.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He was glad she thought that, wrong though she was. They were sympathetic, but they didn’t <i class="calibre6">understand.</i> Better that they didn’t.</p>
<p class="fmtx">For the men chatting together softly, the change was in being shown sunlight again. In being reminded that the darkness <i class="calibre6">did</i> pass. But perhaps <span aria-label="430" id="pg_430" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>most important, the change was in not merely knowing that you weren’t alone—but in <i class="calibre6">feeling</i> it. Realizing that no matter how isolated you thought you were, no matter how often your brain told you terrible things, there <i class="calibre6">were</i> others who understood.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It wouldn’t fix everything. But it was a start.</p>
