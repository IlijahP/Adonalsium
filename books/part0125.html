<p class="lti"><span aria-label="934" id="pg_934" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">I remember so few of those centuries. I am a blur. A smear on the page. A gaunt stretch of ink, made all the more insubstantial with each passing day.</span></p>
<p class="tni">Venli knelt on the floor of a secluded hallway on the fifteenth floor of Urithiru. The stones whispered to her that the place had once been called Ur. The word meant “original” in the Dawnchant. An ancient place, with ancient stones.</p>
<p class="fmtx">There was a spren that lived here. Not dead, as Raboniel had once proclaimed. This spren was the veins of the tower, its inner metal and crystal running through walls, ceilings, floors.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The stones had not been created by that spren, though a grand project had reshaped them. Reshaped Ur, the original mountain that had been here before. The stones <i class="calibre6">remembered</i> being that mountain. They remembered so many things, which they expressed to Venli. Not with words. Rather as impressions, like those a hand left in crem before it dried.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Or the impression Venli’s hands left in the floor as they sank into the eager stone. <i class="calibre6">Remember,</i> the stones whispered. <i class="calibre6">Remember what you have forgotten.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">She remembered sitting at her mother’s feet as a child, listening to the songs. The music had flowed like water, etching patterns in her brain—memories—like the passage of time etched canals in stone.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Listeners were not like humans, who grew slow as trees. Listeners grew like vines, quick and eager. By age three, she’d been singing with her mother. By age ten, she’d been considered an adult. Venli remembered those years—looking up to Eshonai, who seemed so big, although just <span aria-label="935" id="pg_935" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>a year older than Venli. She had vague memories of holding her father’s finger as he sang with her mother.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She remembered love. Family. Grandparents, cousins. How had she forgotten? As a child, ambition and love had been like two sides of her face, each with its own vibrant pattern. To the sound of Odium’s rhythms, one side had shone, while the other withered. She had become a person who wanted only to achieve her goals—not because those goals would help others, but because of the goals themselves.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was in that moment that Venli saw for herself the depth of his lies. He claimed to be of all Passions, and yet where was the love she’d once felt? The love for her mother? Her sister? Her friends? For a while, she’d even forgotten her love for Demid, though it had helped to awaken her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It felt wrong to be using his Light to practice her Surgebinding, but the stones whispered that it was well. Odium and his tone had become part of Roshar, as Cultivation and Honor—who had not been created alongside the planet—had become part of it. His power was natural, and no more wrong or right than any other part of nature.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli searched for something else. The tone of Cultivation. Odium’s song could suffuse her, fueling her powers and enflaming her emotions, but that tone … that tone had belonged to her people long before he’d arrived. While she searched for it, she listened to her mother’s songs in her mind. Like chains, spiked into the stone so they’d remain strong during storms, they reached backward through time. Through generations.</p>
<p class="fmtx">To her people, leaving the battlefield. Walking away rather than continuing to squabble over the same ground over and over. They hadn’t merely rejected the singer gods, they’d rejected the <i class="calibre6">conflict.</i> Holding to family, singing to Love despite their dull forms, they’d left the war and gone a new way.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The tone snapped into her mind, Cultivation and Odium mixing into a harmony, and it thrummed through Venli. She opened her eyes as power spread from her through the stones. They began to shake and vibrate to the sound of her rhythm, liquid, forming peaks and valleys in time with the music. The floor, ceiling, and walls before her rippled, and a trail of people formed from the stone. Moving, alive again, as they strode away from pain, and war, and killing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Freedom. The stones whispered to her of freedom. Rock seemed so stable, so unchangeable, but if you saw it on the timescale of spren, it was always changing. <i class="calibre6">Deliberately.</i> Over centuries. She had never known her ancestors, but she knew their songs. She could sing those and imitate their courage. Their love. Their wisdom.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The power slipped from her, as it always did. The tone faded, and her <span aria-label="936" id="pg_936" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>control over the stone ended. She needed more practice and more Light. Still, she didn’t need Timbre’s encouraging thrum to keep her spirits high as she stood. For she had in front of her, in miniature, a sculpture of her ancestors striking out toward the unknown.</p>
<p class="fmtx">More, she had their songs. Because of her mother’s diligent and insistent teaching, the songs had not died with the listeners.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">An hour later, Venli walked the hallways much lower in the tower, waiting for Leshwi.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She met with the Heavenly One almost every day. Raboniel knew the meetings were happening, of course. And Leshwi knew that Raboniel knew. Still, Venli and Leshwi met in secret; it was all part of the dance of politics between the Fused.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They met as if by happenstance. Leshwi hovered solemnly through a corridor at the right time, her long black train rustling against the stone. Venli fell into step beside her mistress.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The Pursuer has found the Windrunner’s parents, Ancient One,” Venli said. “I’m certain of it. He posted two nightform Regals at the Radiant infirmary.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Which ones?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Urialin and Nistar.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“‘Light’ and ‘mystery,’” Leshwi said, translating their names from the ancient language. Like many of the Regals, they had taken new names for themselves upon their awakening. “Yes, this is a signal. But the Pursuer is not that subtle; if you look, I suspect that Raboniel is the one who suggested those two.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What do we do?” Venli said to Anxiety.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Nothing, for now. My authority extends far enough to protect them. This is merely a warning.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Raboniel threatens to let the Pursuer have the humans,” Venli said. “That is why she posted those two guards. To lord her advantage over us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Perhaps,” Leshwi said, floating with her hands behind her back. “Perhaps not. Raboniel does not think like other Fused, Venli. She hears a much grander song. A skewed and twisted one, but one she seeks to sing without traditional regard for Odium’s plans or those of Honor, now dead.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“She makes her own side then,” Venli said. “She seeks to play both armies against one another and profit herself.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Do not transpose your mortal ambitions upon Raboniel,” Leshwi said to Ridicule. “You think too small, Venli, to understand her. <i class="calibre6">I</i> think too <span aria-label="937" id="pg_937" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>small to understand her. Regardless, you did well in bringing this to me. Watch for other signs like this.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">They reached the atrium, the hallway they’d been following merging with it like a river flowing into a sea. Here, Heavenly Ones soared up and down, delivering supplies to the scouts and Masked Ones on the upper floors. Those continued to keep watch for Windrunners. The charade was wearing thin at this point; Raboniel was certain Dalinar Kholin had seen through it and knew something very wrong was happening at the tower.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The supplies to the upper floors could have been delivered via the lifts. However, Raboniel had put the Heavenly Ones to work, making it very clear that she had both the authority and the inclination to keep them busy.</p>
<p class="fmtx">This had driven off many of them, who preferred their sanctuaries in Kholinar. Perhaps that had been the point. Leshwi instead did as she was asked. She floated up and over the railing, her long train slipping over and then falling to drift in the open air beneath her. Another Heavenly One soared upward past them, trailing cloth of gold and red.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ancient One,” Venli said to Craving, stepping up to the railing. “What are we watching Raboniel for, if not to understand how she’s trying to gain advantage over us? What is the purpose of my spying?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We watch,” Leshwi said, floating down to eye level with Venli, “because we are frightened. To Raboniel, the games of men and singers are petty things—but so are their <i class="calibre6">lives.</i> We watch her, Venli, because we want a world to remain when she is finished with her plots.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli felt a chill, attuning the Terrors. As Leshwi flew off, Venli took a lift, haunted by those words. <i class="calibre6">The games of men and singers are petty things … but so are their lives.…</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">The ominous words pulled Venli down from her earlier optimism. After stepping off the lift, she decided to stop and check on Rlain and the others. She couldn’t help attuning Agony at the idea of those Regals in the infirmary. At least the surgeon and his wife had the good sense to mostly stay out of sight.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli slipped into the draped-off section of the room, where Hesina was keeping watch today. She nodded as Venli entered, then grimaced and glanced toward the others inside. There was a new human here, one Venli didn’t recognize, who stood with his eyes down, not speaking.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A tension in the room was coming entirely from Lirin and Rlain, who faced off at the rear, Rlain humming softly to Betrayal. What on Roshar?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I can’t believe I’m hearing this,” Rlain said. “I <i class="calibre6">can’t</i> believe it. He’s your <i class="calibre6">son.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My son is long dead, bridgeman,” Lirin said, quickly packing a small bag full of surgical implements. “Kaladin kept trying to explain this, and <span aria-label="938" id="pg_938" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>I only recently started understanding. He doesn’t want to be my son anymore. If that’s the case, it’s difficult for me to see him as anything other than a killer and an agitator. Someone who recklessly endangered not just my family, but the lives of every human in the tower, while pursuing a vengeful grudge.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So you’re going to leave him to die?” Rlain demanded.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I didn’t say that,” Lirin snapped. “Do <i class="calibre6">not</i> put words in my mouth. I’ll go as I would for anyone wounded.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And afterward?” he demanded. “You said—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I <i class="calibre6">said</i> we’d see,” Lirin said. “It’s possible I’ll need to bring him down here to give him long-term care.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You would give him up for execution!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“If that’s what is required, then so be it. I’ll do my job as a surgeon, then let Kaladin deal with the consequences of his actions. I’m finished being a pawn in games of death. For <i class="calibre6">either</i> side.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain threw up his hands. “What is the point of trying to save him if you’re intending to have him killed!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Quiet!” Venli hissed, glancing out the flimsy drapes toward the others in the room outside. “What is going on here?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin glared at Rlain, who again hummed to Betrayal.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Our son survived the events of the other day,” Hesina said to Venli. “This is one of his friends. He says Kaladin’s powers aren’t working properly, and his wounds aren’t healing. He’s in a coma and is slowly dying of what sounds like internal bleeding.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That or an infection,” Lirin said, stuffing a few more things into his bag. “Can’t tell from the description.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’re not taking you to him,” Rlain said, “unless you <i class="calibre6">promise</i> not to give him and Teft up to the enemy.” He looked to the other man in the room, the newcomer, who nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Then he’ll die for certain,” Lirin snapped. “Blood on <i class="calibre6">your</i> hands.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The two glared at each other, and Venli attuned Irritation. As if she didn’t have enough to worry about.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ll go,” Hesina said, walking over and taking the surgery bag off the table.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Hesina—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He’s my son too,” she said. “Let’s be on with this, Rlain. I can show you how to treat the fever and give him some anti-inflammatories, along with something to fight the infection.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And if it <i class="calibre6">is</i> internal bleeding?” Lirin asked. “He will need surgery. You can’t perform an operation like that in the field, Hesina.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He sounded angry, but those were <i class="calibre6">fearspren</i> at his feet. Not angerspren. The surgeon turned away and pretended to arrange his instruments. But <span aria-label="939" id="pg_939" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>humans were so full of emotion, it spilled out of them. He couldn’t hide what he was feeling from Venli. Frustration. Worry.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He could say what he wanted. But he loved his son.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He needs to be brought here,” Lirin said, his voice laden with pain as plain as any rhythm. “I will go with you to help him. Then … I want you to listen to my suggestion. If he’s in a coma, he <i class="calibre6">will</i> need long-term care. We can put him in this room and pretend he’s unconscious like the others. It’s the best way.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He’d rather die,” the newcomer whispered. There was something odd about his voice that Venli couldn’t place. He slurred his words.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The chamber fell silent. Save for one thing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre vibrated with excitement inside Venli. The little spren was at it so loudly, Venli was certain the others would hear. How could they not?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It was going to catch up to Kal eventually,” Lirin said, his tone morose. “Most soldiers don’t die on the battlefield, you know. Far more die from wounds days later. My son taught you about triage, didn’t he? What did he say about people with wounds like his?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The two former bridgemen glanced at each other.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Make them comfortable,” the human with the slurred words said. “Give them drink. Pain medication, if you can spare it. So they are peaceful when they … when they die.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Again the room grew quiet. All save for Timbre, practically bursting with sound.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">It’s time. It’s time. It’s time!</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">When Venli spoke, she almost believed it was Timbre saying the words and not her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What if,” she said, “I knew about an Edgedancer whose powers still seem to work? One who I think we can rescue?”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">It didn’t take much time to explain the plan. Venli had been thinking about this for days now; she’d only needed some practice with her powers, and a little help from Rlain.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Edgedancer was kept in the same cell Rlain had occupied not long ago. Venli could get through that wall with ease; she was in control of her powers enough for that. The real trick would be pulling off the rescue without revealing or implicating herself.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre pulsed in annoyance as Venli and Rlain hurried toward the cell. The human, Dabbid, was taking another route. Venli didn’t want to be seen walking with him.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="940" id="pg_940" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“How did you get a Shardblade?” Rlain asked softly, to Curiosity. “And how do they not know you have one?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s a long story,” Venli said. Mostly because she hadn’t thought of a proper lie yet.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s Eshonai’s, isn’t it? Do you know what happened to her? I know you said she’s dead … but how?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">She died controlled by a Voidspren,</i> Venli thought, <i class="calibre6">because I tricked her into inviting one into her gemheart. She fell into a chasm after fighting a human Shardbearer, then drowned. Alone. I found her corpse, and—under the direction of a Voidspren—desecrated it by stealing her Shards. But I don’t have them.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">There was a lot she <i class="calibre6">could</i> say. “No. I got it from a dead human. I bonded it while traveling to Kholinar, before the Fused found me and the others.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That was when they … they…” Rlain attuned the Rhythm of the Lost.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes,” Venli said to the same rhythm. “When they took the rest of our friends. They left me because Odium wanted me to travel around, telling lies about our people to ‘inspire’ the newly awakened singers.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m sorry,” Rlain said. “That must have been difficult for you, Venli.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I survived,” Venli said. “But if we’re going to save this Radiant, we <i class="calibre6">need</i> to be certain the Fused can’t trace this break-in to us. You can’t intervene, Rlain. The human has to manage the distraction himself.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain hummed to Consideration.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What?” Venli asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Dabbid isn’t the person I’d put in charge of something like this,” he said. “Until today, I thought he was completely mute.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Is he trustworthy?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Absolutely,” Rlain said. “He’s Bridge Four. But … well, I’d like to know why he spent so long without talking. The bridge runs hit him hard, I know, but there’s something else.” He hummed to Determination. “I won’t intervene unless something goes wrong.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“If you do, we <i class="calibre6">all</i> have to go into hiding,” Venli said to Skepticism. “So make <i class="calibre6">sure</i> before you do anything.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He nodded, still humming to Determination, and they split up at the next intersection. Venli found her way to a particular quiet section of hallway, lit only by her held sphere. Most humans stayed away from this area; the Pursuer’s troops were housed nearby. Raboniel’s occasional orders for peace to be maintained in the tower were barely enough to restrain those soldiers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She attuned Peace—sometimes used by listeners for measuring time. Beyond this wall was the cell. As the fourth movement of the rhythm approached, Venli pressed her hand against the stone and drew in Voidlight, requisitioned just earlier to replace what she’d used. Storms, she hoped news of her taking so much didn’t reach Raboniel.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="941" id="pg_941" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Timbre pulsed reassuringly. This stone, like the one earlier today, responded to Venli’s touch. It shivered and rippled, as if it were getting a good back-scratching.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The stone whispered to her. <i class="calibre6">Move to the side.</i> It guided her to the correct spot to breach the cell. Timbre’s rhythms pulsed through the rock, making it vibrate with the Rhythm of Hope. The fourth movement of Peace arrived—the moment when Rlain would signal Dabbid to go in to the guards, bringing food for their lunch. Merely another servant doing his job. Nothing unusual, even if lunch came early today.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre exulted in the Rhythm of Hope as Venli pushed her hand into the stone. It felt good, warm and enveloping. Unlike what happened with the Deepest Ones, Venli displaced the rock. It became as crem in her fingers, soft to the touch.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She wasn’t expert enough to get it to move on its own into the shapes she wanted. It usually did what it wanted in those cases, such as forming the tiny statues on the floor above. So for now, she simply pushed her hand forward until it hit air on the other side. Then she pressed with her other hand and pulled the two apart, forming an opening straight through the stone—the normally hard rock curling and bunching up before her touch.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A surprised set of human eyes appeared at the other end of the foot-long hole, looking through at her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m going to get you out,” Venli whispered to the Rhythm of Pleading, “but you have to <i class="calibre6">promise</i> you won’t tell anyone what I’ve done. You won’t tell them about the powers I’m using. Not even other Radiants. They think I’m cutting you out with a Shardblade.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What are you?” the human whispered in Alethi.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Promise me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Fine, promised. Done. Hurry. The guards are eating, and they didn’t even share none of it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli continued shoving aside the stone. It took a ton of Light, and Timbre pulsed to Consolation—apparently she thought Venli’s efforts crude, lacking finesse and skill.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Well, it did the job. She managed to form a hole big enough for the human girl. When Venli let go of the stone, it hardened instantly—she had to shake a few chips of it free of her fingers. The girl poked it, then hopped through.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Hopefully the guards would assume a human Stoneward had survived and saved the girl. Venli gestured for the Edgedancer to follow her—but the girl wavered. She seemed as if she was going to bolt away in another direction.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Please,” Venli said. “We need you. To save a life. If you run now, he’ll die.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="942" id="pg_942" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Who?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Stormblessed,” Venli said. “Please, hurry with me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re one of them,” the girl said. “How’d you get Radiant powers?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I … am not Radiant,” Venli said. “I have powers from the Fused that are like Radiant powers. I’m a friend of Rlain. The listener who was a bridgeman? Please. I wouldn’t free you only to put you in danger, but we <i class="calibre6">need</i> to go, now!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The girl cocked her head, then nodded for Venli to go first. The Edgedancer followed on silent feet, sticking to the shadows.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Eshonai used to walk like that,</i> Venli thought. <i class="calibre6">Quietly in the wilderness, to not disturb the wildlife.</i> This girl didn’t have that same air about her though.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre was pulsing contentedly to Hope. Venli couldn’t feel the same yet, not until she was certain Rlain and Dabbid hadn’t been caught. She led the little Radiant girl to a room nearby to wait.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re a traitor to them, then?” the girl asked her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t know what I am,” Venli said. “Other than someone who didn’t want to see a child kept in a cage.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli jumped almost to the ceiling when Rlain finally strode in with Dabbid. The quiet bridgeman ran over and hugged the human girl, who grinned.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Eh, moolie,” she said. “Strange friends ya got these days. You seen a chicken around here? Big red one? I lost ’im when I was running away.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid shook his head, then knelt before the girl. “Healing. It works?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Eh!” she said. “You can talk!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He nodded.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Say ‘buttress,’” she told him. “It’s my favorite word.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Healing?” he asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yeah, I can still heal,” she said. “I think. I should be able to help him.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He took her hand, insistent.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ll go with you,” Rlain said. He glanced at Venli and she hummed to Skepticism, indicating she wouldn’t go. She had to attend Raboniel.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I won’t stay away too long,” Rlain promised her. “I don’t want to draw suspicion.” The other two left, but he lingered, then hummed to Appreciation. “I’m sorry about what I said when you first saw me in the cell. You’re not selfish, Venli.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I am,” she said. “A lot of things are confusing to me these days—but of that fact I’m certain.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No,” he said. “Today you’re a hero. I know you’ve been through rough times, but today…” He grinned and hummed to Appreciation again, then ducked out after the others.</p>
<p class="fmtx">If only he knew the whole story. Still, she felt upbeat as she headed toward the scholar rooms below.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="943" id="pg_943" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Can I say the words now?” she asked Timbre.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The pulse indicated the negative. Not yet.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“When?” Venli asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A simple, straightforward pulse was her answer.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">You’ll know.</i></p>
