<p class="lti"><span aria-label="535" id="pg_535" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">Regardless, please make yourself known to me when you travel my lands. It is distressing that you think you need to move in the shadows.</span></p>
<p class="tni">By the time they heard confirmation that the queen had surrendered, sunlight was beginning to stream through the windows of the clinic. Kaladin and his family had spent the entire night seeing patients. Twenty hours, a full day, without sleep.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Even the exhaustionspren near Kaladin seemed tired, swirling slowly, lethargic. The messenger woman sat down at their table in the clinic, bleary eyed and wearing a disheveled uniform, as she accepted a cup of cold tea from Kaladin’s father.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The queen attempted a final push to restore the Radiants,” the woman said. “I don’t know what that entailed—only that the soldiers involved are dead now. I’ve been running messages to the neighborhoods on the sixth floor. But yes, in answer to your question, I’ve seen Queen Navani and the head of the Fused army together. She confirmed the surrender to me. We are to live under singer law, and not resist.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Stormwinds,” Kaladin whispered. “I never realized how blind I’d feel without spanreeds.” It had taken hours for any sort of factual information to filter up to the sixth floor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So we’re supposed to go right back to living under their rule?” Kaladin’s mother said from her seat at the table.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It wasn’t so bad,” Lirin said. “The highlords won’t like it, but it won’t matter much for the rest of us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Fabrials don’t work,” Hesina said. “We can’t heat our rooms, not to <span aria-label="536" id="pg_536" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>mention our food. The water pumps will have halted. This tower won’t remain livable for long.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The Fused use their powers,” Lirin replied. “Maybe if we infuse the fabrials with Voidlight, they’ll work.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Pardon, Brightlord,” the scout said, “but that … feels wrong for many reasons.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin had started rummaging in the cupboard for something to eat, so he didn’t see his father’s reaction at being called “Brightlord.” He could guess though. It was an odd situation anyway, considering that Lirin’s eyes hadn’t changed, he’d simply been adopted into Kaladin’s house. Rank was becoming a jumbled mess these days.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Kaladin, son,” Hesina said, “why don’t you go lie down?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Why?” he said, getting out a stack of flatbread, then counting how many pieces they had.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’ve been prowling about like a caged animal,” she said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No I haven’t.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Son…” she said, in a calm—but infuriatingly wise—voice.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He set down the bread and felt at his brow, which was cold from sweat. He took a deep breath, then turned around to face them, his father leaning against the wall, his mother at the table with the messenger woman. She had white and grey hair, but was young enough that it seemed premature, and had a pair of white gloves tucked into her belt. An Alethi master-servant doing double duty as a messenger.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re all taking this too calmly,” Kaladin said, tossing up his hands. “Don’t you realize what this means? They control the tower. They control the Oathgates. That is <i class="calibre6">it.</i> The war is over.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Brightlord Dalinar still has the bulk of the Radiants with him,” Alili, the messenger, said. “And our armies were mostly deployed around the world.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And now they’re all isolated!” Kaladin said. “We can’t fight a war on multiple fronts without the Oathgates. And what if the enemy can repeat whatever they did here? What if they start making Radiant powers go away on every battlefield?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">That quieted her. Kaladin tried to imagine what the war would be like without Windrunners or Edgedancers. Already, the battlefields were starting to look very little like the ones he’d known during his days as a spearman. Fewer large-scale formations maneuvering against other blocks of men. Those were too easy to disrupt from above, or by other types of Fused.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Men spent their days in protected camps, making only sudden surges to claim ground and shove away the enemy. Battles stretched on for months, <span aria-label="537" id="pg_537" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>instead of occurring in decisive engagements. Nobody quite knew how to fight a war like this—well, nobody on <i class="calibre6">their</i> side, at least.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I keep waiting,” Kaladin said, wiping his brow again, “for the thunder to hit. The lightning struck last night. We saw the flash, and need to brace ourselves for the shock wave.…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Brightlord,” Alili said, “pardon, but … maybe you could help the other Radiants? To do whatever you did?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What did I do?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That’s what I’m asking,” she said. “Again, pardon, but Brightlord Stormblessed … you’re the sole Radiant I’ve seen in the tower who is still standing. Whatever the enemy did, it knocked out all the others. Every <i class="calibre6">single</i> one. Except you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He thought of Teft, lying on the slab in the other room. They’d spooned broth into his mouth, and he had taken it, stirring and muttering softly between mouthfuls.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The long night weighed on Kaladin. He <i class="calibre6">did</i> need rest. Probably should have taken it hours ago. But he worried about his patients, the men suffering from battle shock. Before all this had happened, he’d gotten them rooms on the fourth floor, among the men who had lost arms or legs in the war, and who now did work maintaining gear for other soldiers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin’s patients had been making real progress. He could imagine exactly how they felt now though, living through another horror as the battle—so frequently a source of nightmares to them—found them again. They must be beside themselves.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Not just them,</i> Kaladin thought, wiping his brow again with his hand.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The messenger woman rose and stretched, then bowed and moved on her way to continue delivering the news. Before she reached the front door, however, Syl zipped in from underneath it, twirled around in a few circles, then zipped back out.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Enemy soldier,” Kaladin said under his breath to his parents, “coming this way.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Indeed, as the messenger left, a singer wearing a sleek Regal form peeked in to check on Kaladin and his parents. The singer lingered only a short time before turning away. There weren’t enough of them yet to guard each and every home. Kaladin suspected that as more and more singers moved into the tower, he and his family wouldn’t be able to speak as openly as they’d been doing so far this morning.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We should get some sleep,” Lirin said to Kaladin.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The other townspeople—” Kaladin began.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Laral and I will visit them,” Hesina said, rising. “I got some sleep earlier.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“But—”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="538" id="pg_538" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Son,” Lirin said. “If the Radiants are in comas, that means no Edgedancers—and no Regrowth. You and I need sleep, because we’re going to become <i class="calibre6">very</i> busy men over the next few days. There’s an entire tower full of frightened people, and likely as not a few hotheaded soldiers will take it upon themselves to make trouble despite the queen’s orders. They’re all going to need two rested surgeons.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Hesina gave her husband a fond touch on the cheek with her safehand, then a kiss. She pulled a handkerchief from her pocket and gave it to Kaladin as he found himself yet again wiping his brow. Then she left to go visit Laral—who had seen the messenger before them and already knew the situation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin reluctantly joined his father and walked down the long hallway past the patient rooms toward the family’s living quarters.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What if I’m one of those hotheads?” Kaladin asked. “What if <i class="calibre6">I</i> can’t live with this?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin stopped in the hallway. “I thought we’d discussed this already, son.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You think I can ignore the fact that the enemy has conquered my home?” Kaladin said. “You think you can just turn me into a good, well-behaved slave like—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Like me?” Lirin asked with a sigh. His eyes flicked up, likely noting the brands on Kaladin’s forehead, mostly covered by his hair. “What would have happened, son, if instead of trying so hard to escape all those years, you’d instead proven yourself to your masters? What if you’d shown them you could heal instead of kill? How much misery would you have saved the world if you’d used your talents instead of your fists?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re telling me to be a good slave and do what I’m told.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m telling you to <i class="calibre6">think</i>!” his father snapped. “I’m telling you that if you want to change the world, you have to stop being part of the problem!” Lirin calmed himself with obvious difficulty, making fists and breathing in deeply. “Son, think about what all those years spent fighting did to you. How they broke you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin looked away, not trusting himself to answer.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Now,” Lirin said, “think about these last few weeks. How good it felt to be helping for once.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“There is more than one way to help.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And your nightmares?” Lirin asked. “The cold sweats? The times where your mind numbs? Was that caused by <i class="calibre6">my</i> kind of help, or <i class="calibre6">your</i> kind? Son, our mandate is to find those who are hurt, then see them cared for. We can do that even if the enemy has conquered us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">In a way, Kaladin could understand what his father said. “Your words make sense up here,” Kaladin said, tapping his head. “But not down here.” He slapped his breast.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="539" id="pg_539" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“That’s always been your problem, son. Letting your heart override your head.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My head can’t be trusted sometimes,” Kaladin said. “Can you blame me? Besides, isn’t the entire reason we became surgeons <i class="calibre6">because</i> of the heart? Because we care?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We need both heart and mind,” Lirin said. “The heart might provide the purpose, but the head provides the method, the path. Passion is nothing without a plan. <i class="calibre6">Wanting</i> something doesn’t make it happen.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I can acknowledge—<i class="calibre6">have</i> to acknowledge—that you accomplished great things serving Dalinar Kholin. But with the Radiants down and most of the king’s surgeons on the battlefield, <i class="calibre6">we</i> are what stands between the people of this tower and deathspren. You acknowledge that you don’t think right sometimes? Then trust <i class="calibre6">me.</i> Trust <i class="calibre6">my thoughts.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin grimaced, but nodded. It was true that his thoughts had proven—time after time—that they couldn’t be trusted. Besides, what did he think he was going to do? Fight a war against the invaders all by himself? After Navani had surrendered?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Before retiring, they checked on the unconscious people in the patient rooms. The Stoneward was completely out cold, less responsive than Teft, though Lirin was able to get her to take soup by spooning it to her lips. Kaladin studied her—checking her eyes, her heart rate, her temperature. Then he moved over to Teft. The bearded Windrunner shifted, his eyes closed, and when Kaladin put broth to his lips he took it far more eagerly. His hands twitched, and though Kaladin couldn’t make out anything he was saying, he kept muttering under his breath.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">He’s a Windrunner, of the same oath as me,</i> Kaladin thought. <i class="calibre6">I’m awake when the others fell. Teft is close to being awake.</i> Was there a connection?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Whatever fabrial the enemy was using to do this, perhaps it didn’t work as well on Windrunners. He needed to see the other Radiants and compare them. There had been around two dozen other Windrunners in the tower. His status as a surgeon should let him visit them and check their vitals.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Storms. His father was correct. Kaladin could accomplish far more by backing down than he could by fighting.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl came zipping into the room a short time later. Lirin noticed her too, so she’d made herself visible to him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Syl,” Kaladin said, “will you check again to see if you can spot Teft’s spren? He seems like he’s coming closer to waking, so she might be becoming more visible.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No time,” Syl said, turning into the shape of a young woman with a sword strapped to her waist, wearing a scout’s uniform. She halted in the air, standing as if on an invisible platform. “They’re coming.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Another Regal coming to check in on us?” Kaladin said.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="540" id="pg_540" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Worse,” Syl said. “A group of soldiers, led by a different Regal, is searching each residence, methodically heading this direction. They’re hunting for something.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Or some<i class="calibre6">one,</i>” Kaladin said. “They’ve heard that Stormblessed is awake.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Don’t jump to conclusions, son,” Lirin said. “If they were searching for you specifically, they’d have come straight here. I’ll go see what this is about. If they <i class="calibre6">are</i> looking for you, escape out the window and we’ll decide what to do later.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin withdrew into the family room, which had doors to their bedrooms—including the small closet where little Oroden was sleeping in his crib. Kaladin didn’t go to his bedroom though. He cracked the door into the hallway, and was able to hear voices when his father opened the door at the far front of the clinic. Unfortunately, he couldn’t hear what they were saying. He nodded to Syl, who risked zipping out to get closer and overhear.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Before she could return, the voices drew nearer. Kaladin made out the Regal by the rhythm of his speech.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“… don’t care if you’re a surgeon, darkeyes,” the soldier said. “I have the queen’s sealed writ here, and its instructions supersede what you might have been told by messengers. All Radiants are to be taken into custody.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“These are my patients,” Lirin said. “They were entrusted to my care. Please; they’re no danger to you like this.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your queen accepted these terms,” the Regal replied. “Complain to her.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin peeked out the door into the hallway. A Regal led five ordinary warform singers. Their larger figures appeared cramped in the stone corridor as they walked to the two patient rooms. So they <i class="calibre6">weren’t</i> after him, not specifically. They were searching for fallen Radiants.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Indeed, the Regal gestured his attendants toward the first exam room. Two moved out soon after, carrying the fallen Stoneward between them. They shoved Lirin aside as they carted her off down the hallway.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl came zipping back to Kaladin, agitated as she moved into the room with him. “They don’t seem to know about you. Only that the surgeon has a couple of fallen Radiants.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin nodded, though he’d grown tense.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I can care for these far better than you can,” Lirin said. “Removing them like this could be dangerous to their health, even deadly.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Why would we care?” the Regal said, both tone and rhythm sounding amused. Two of his soldiers took the Stoneward’s squires, one each, and hauled them out of the second exam room. “I think we should throw them all off the tower and rid ourselves of a huge problem. The Fused want us to collect them though. Guess they want to have the fun of killing these themselves.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="541" id="pg_541" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">He’s posturing,</i> Kaladin thought. <i class="calibre6">The Fused wouldn’t go to the effort of taking the Radiants captive only to kill them.</i> Would they?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Did it matter?</p>
<p class="fmtx">They were going to take Teft.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Regal moved into the first exam room, and Kaladin’s father followed, making more objections. Kaladin stood with one hand on the wall, one hand on the door, breathing deeply. Wind surged through the window behind, brushing past him, bearing with it two twisting windspren that moved as lines of light.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A hundred objections held him. His father’s arguments. His soul in fragments. The knowledge that he was probably too tired to be making decisions. The fact that the queen had decided it was best to end hostilities.</p>
<p class="fmtx">So many reasons to stay where he was. But one reason to move.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">They were going to take Teft.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin pulled open the door and stepped into the hallway, feeling the inevitable shift of a boulder perched on the top of a slope. Just. Beginning. To tip.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Kaladin…” Syl said, landing on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It was a nice dream, wasn’t it, Syl?” he asked. “That we could escape? Find peace at long last?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Such a wonderful dream,” she whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You ready for this?” he asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She nodded, and he stepped into the doorway of the exam room. Two enemy soldiers remained in the room: one warform and the stormform Regal. The Regal had helped get Teft up onto the regular soldier’s shoulders.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin looked straight at Kaladin, then shook his head urgently, his eyes going wide.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You will put him down,” Kaladin said to the singers. “And leave quietly. Send one of the Fused to get him, if they’re so insistent.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The two froze, and the Regal sized him up. “Go back to bed, boy,” he eventually said. “You don’t want to try my patience today.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin dashed forward, trying to push Kaladin out of the room. With a quick pivot to the side, Kaladin sent his father tumbling into the hall—and hopefully out of danger. He stepped back into the doorway.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Why not go for reinforcements?” Kaladin said to the two singers. Almost more a plea than a request. “Don’t press this issue right now.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Regal gestured for his companion to set Teft back onto the exam table, and for a moment Kaladin thought they might actually do what he said. Then the Regal unhooked the axe from its sheath at his side.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No!” Lirin said from behind. “Don’t do this!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">In response, Kaladin drew in a breath of Stormlight. His body came <span aria-label="542" id="pg_542" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>alight with the inner storm, and wisps of luminescent smoke began to curl from his skin.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That gave the two singers pause, until the warform pointed. “That’s <i class="calibre6">him,</i> Brightlord! The one the Pursuer is searching for! He matches the description exactly!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Regal grinned. “You’re going to make me very rich, human.” Dark red lightning crackled across his skin. The warform shied away, hitting the counter and causing surgery implements to clink against one another.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin grabbed Kaladin from behind.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin stood quietly on that precipice. Balanced.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Regal leaped forward, swinging his axe.</p>
<p class="fmtx">And Kaladin stepped off the edge.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He shook free of his father’s grip and shoved him backward with one hand, then caught the Regal’s arm with his other before the axe could fall. Kaladin braced himself for the <i class="calibre6">jolt</i> of energy that shot through him at touching a stormform—he’d fought these before. It stunned him for a moment nonetheless, so he wasn’t ready to guard as the Regal cuffed him across the face, ripping his cheek with the barbed carapace on the back of his hand.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Stormlight would heal that. Kaladin got his other hand up, preventing another punch while continuing to hold back the axe. The two struggled for a moment, then Kaladin managed to get the advantage, tipping their center of balance forward so he could twist and ram his shoulder into the Regal.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Storms</i> it hurt. That carapace was no joke. Still, the maneuver put his opponent momentarily off balance, so Kaladin was able to control the fight, spinning his enemy around and slamming the creature’s hand into the corner of an exam table. A resounding <i class="calibre6">snap</i> split the air, and the carapace on the hand cracked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Regal hissed in pain and dropped the axe. But then he pivoted hard and rammed his side into Kaladin’s chest, shoving him against the counter. Kaladin’s father was shouting, but the warform—instead of helping—remained by the opposite wall. He didn’t seem eager to attack a Radiant.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Without Stormlight, Kaladin wouldn’t have been able to withstand the constant jolts of energy from the stormform’s touch. As it was, he was able to hold on—not letting the enemy force him back too much—until the Regal tried another punch. At the windup, Kaladin hooked his leg around the foot of his opponent, then sent them both to the ground.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He landed with a grunt and tried to roll into position to choke his opponent unconscious. If the fight ended without bloodshed, perhaps his father would forgive him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Unfortunately, Kaladin hadn’t done a lot of wrestling. He knew enough <span aria-label="543" id="pg_543" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>to keep himself from being pinned easily, but the Regal was stronger than he was, and that carapace kept jabbing in surprising places and interfering with his holds. The Regal leveraged his superior weight and strength, twisting Kaladin around with a grunt. Then—with Kaladin pinned beneath him—the creature began pummeling him in the face with his good fist, the one that hadn’t cracked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin breathed in a gasp of Stormlight, draining the spheres on the counter. He brought his fist up and slammed it into the back of the hand that had cracked earlier. His enemy flinched, and Kaladin was able to kick free, throwing the Regal off—though both slammed into the counters in the tight confines as he did so.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin scrambled to find his feet so he could attack his enemy from above—but the Regal began to glow red. The hairs on Kaladin’s arms stood up, and he had a fraction of a second to duck to the side as a flash of light—and an earsplitting <i class="calibre6">crack</i>—filled the room.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He hit the ground, blinded and deafened, the sharp scent of a lightning strike filling his nostrils. Strange and distinctive, it was a scent he associated with rainfall. Kaladin didn’t think he’d been struck directly—stormforms had trouble aiming their lightning—but it took a moment for Kaladin’s Stormlight to heal his ears and restore his vision.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A shadow moved over him, swinging its axe down. Kaladin twisted to the side just in time. The axe clanged against the ground.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I’m sorry, Father,</i> Kaladin thought, reaching for the scalpel in his boot. As the axe fell again, Kaladin let it bite him in the left shoulder, praying his Stormlight would hold. He rammed the scalpel into the side of the Regal’s knee, directly between bits of carapace.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Regal screamed and stumbled. Kaladin’s shoulder hurt like Damnation, but he pushed through the pain and leaped to his feet. His Stormlight ran out as he rushed his enemy, toppling them again—but this time Kaladin fell with more care and dropped on top of the Regal. With the momentum of the fall, he rammed his scalpel into the creature’s neck, right above its carapace gorget.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The knife wasn’t intended for battle, but it <i class="calibre6">was</i> sharpened to exactness. Kaladin twisted it and swiftly cut the carotid artery, then threw himself up.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He stumbled back against the counter, covered in sweat, panting, his hearing not fully healed from the blast. The Regal thrashed on the floor, and orange blood … Well, Kaladin turned away. Some sights were sickening even for a surgeon.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Even for a soldier,</i> he corrected. <i class="calibre6">You’re no surgeon.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">He looked across the room at the singer who huddled beside the far wall. He’d watched, stunned, and hadn’t intervened.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="544" id="pg_544" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Haven’t been in many fights, have you?” Kaladin asked, hoarse.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The singer jumped, his eyes wide. He was in warform, so he appeared fearsome, but his expression told another story. That of a person who wanted to be anywhere else, a person horrified by the brutality of the fight.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Storms … He hadn’t considered that singers might feel battle shock too.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Go,” Kaladin said, then winced as the dying Regal’s leg thumped against the wall with a frantic, panicked sound. Bleeding out always seemed to happen too quickly to your friends, and not quickly enough to those you killed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The singer stared at him, haunted, and Kaladin realized the malen might also have been deafened by the lightning. Kaladin pointed, mouthing the word. “Go!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The singer scrambled away, leaving wet orange footprints from the dying singer’s blood. Kaladin pulled himself over to the opposite counter, where a few spheres still glowed. He drew those in and healed the rest of his wounds. He should have kept another pouch on him. This had been coming.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He searched out the doorway, and found his father on the floor where Kaladin had shoved him, lit by morning light coming in through the distant window.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You all right?” Kaladin asked him. “Did that blast hurt you?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin stood up, staring past Kaladin. Into the room, square at the dying Regal. In the other room, Oroden had started crying. Then Lirin, overcoming his shock, scrambled into the room to try to help the dying singer.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Father is fine,</i> Kaladin thought. The thunder of stormform lightning blasts—at least those made by a single individual—wasn’t as bad as that of real lightning. As long as you were sheltered, as his father had been, you wouldn’t suffer permanent hearing loss.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin tiredly glanced to Syl, who sat on the counter with her hands in her lap. Her eyes were closed, her head turned away from the dying Regal as Lirin tried to stanch the blood flow. Kaladin had killed dozens, perhaps hundreds of them during this war—though he’d tried to focus his attention on the Fused. He’d told himself that those fights were more meaningful, but the truth was that he hated killing common soldiers. They never seemed to have much of a chance against him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Yet each Fused he killed meant something even worse. A noncombatant would be sacrificed to give that Fused new life, so each one of <i class="calibre6">them</i> Kaladin killed meant taking the life of some housewife or craftsman.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He moved over to Teft, Kaladin’s glowing body illuminating the man, unconscious on the table. Kaladin spared a momentary worry for the Stoneward who had been taken. Could he somehow rescue her too?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="545" id="pg_545" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">Don’t be a fool, Kaladin. You barely saved Teft. In fact, you might not have saved him yet. Deal with the current problems before creating new ones.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Nearby, Lirin gave up, lowering his head and slumping in place as he knelt before the body. It had stopped moving, finally.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’ll need to hide,” Kaladin said to his father. “I’ll fetch Mother.” He surveyed his bloody clothing. “Perhaps you should do that, actually.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How <i class="calibre6">dare</i> you!” Lirin whispered, his voice hoarse.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin hesitated, shocked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How dare you kill in this place!” Lirin shouted, turning on Kaladin, angerspren pooling at his feet. “My sanctuary. The place where we heal! What is <i class="calibre6">wrong</i> with you?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They were going to take Teft,” Kaladin said. “Kill him.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You don’t know that!” Lirin said. He stared at his bloodied hands. “You … You just…” He took a deep breath. “The Fused are probably gathering the Radiants to keep them in one location, and watch to see that none of them wake up!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“<i class="calibre6">You</i> don’t know <i class="calibre6">that,</i>” Kaladin said. “I wasn’t going to let them take him. He’s my friend.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Is that it, or did you just want an excuse?” Lirin’s hands trembled as he tried to wipe the blood onto his trousers. When he looked back at Kaladin, something seemed to have broken in him, tears on his cheeks. Storms, he seemed <i class="calibre6">exhausted.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Heralds above…” Lirin whispered. “They really <i class="calibre6">did</i> kill my boy, didn’t they? What have they done to you?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin’s smidgen of Stormlight ran out. Damnation, he was so <i class="calibre6">tired.</i> “I’ve tried to tell you. Your boy died years ago.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin stared at the floor, wet with blood. “Go. They’ll come for you now.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You need to go into hiding with me,” Kaladin said. “They’ll know you’re my—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’re not going anywhere with you,” Lirin snapped.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Don’t play the sixth fool, Father,” Kaladin said. “You can’t let them take you after this.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I can and will!” Lirin shouted, standing up. “Because <i class="calibre6">I</i> will take responsibility for what I’ve done! <i class="calibre6">I</i> will work within whatever confines I must in order to protect people! <i class="calibre6">I</i> have taken oaths not to harm!” He grimaced, sickened. “Oh, Almighty. You murdered a man inside my home.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It wasn’t murder,” Kaladin said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin didn’t respond.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It <i class="calibre6">wasn’t</i> murder.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin sank to the floor. “Just … go,” he said, his voice growing soft again. The grief in it, the disappointment, was far worse than the anger <span aria-label="546" id="pg_546" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>had been. “I will … find a way to get the rest of us out of this. That singer saw me trying to make you stop. They won’t harm a surgeon who didn’t fight. But you, they’ll kill.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin hesitated. Could he really leave them here?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Storms…” Lirin whispered. “Storms, my son has become a monster.…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin steeled himself, then slipped into the back room and recovered an extra pouch of spheres he kept there. Then he returned to the exam room, trying—and failing—to avoid the blood. He lifted Teft with a grunt, putting him in a medic’s carry across his back.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ve taken oaths too, Father,” he said. “I’m sorry I’m not the man you wanted me to be. But if I <i class="calibre6">were</i> a monster, I would never have let that other soldier go.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He left, running for the uninhabited center of the sixth floor as shouts in the singer tongue began to sound behind him.</p>
