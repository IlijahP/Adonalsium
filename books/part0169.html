<p class="tni">The preceding list is an imperfect gathering of traditional Vorin symbolism associated with the Ten Essences. Bound together, these form the Double Eye of the Almighty, an eye with two pupils representing the creation of plants and creatures. This is also the basis for the hourglass shape that was often associated with the Knights Radiant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="fmtx">Ancient scholars also placed the ten orders of Knights Radiant on this list, alongside the Heralds themselves, who each had a classical association with one of the numbers and Essences.</p>
<p class="fmtx">I’m not certain yet how the ten levels of Voidbinding or its cousin the Old Magic fit into this paradigm, if indeed they can. My research <span aria-label="1224" id="pg_1224" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>suggests that, indeed, there should be another series of abilities that is even more esoteric than the Voidbindings. Perhaps the Old Magic fits into those, though I am beginning to suspect that it is something entirely different.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Note that I currently believe the concept of the “Body Focus” to be more a matter of philosophical interpretation than an actual attribute of this Investiture and its manifestations.</p>

<h2 class="bmsh"><span class="esans_tresillian_script_bold_b_">ON THE CREATION OF FABRIALS</span></h2>
<p class="tni">Five groupings of fabrial have been discovered so far. The methods of their creation are carefully guarded by the artifabrian community, but they appear to be the work of dedicated scientists, as opposed to the more mystical Surgebindings once performed by the Knights Radiant. I am more and more convinced that the creation of these devices requires forced enslavement of transformative cognitive entities, known as “spren” to the local communities.</p>
</section>
<section type="division">
<h2 class="bmh"><small class="calibre8">ALTERING FABRIALS</small></h2>
<p class="stni"><i class="calibre6">Augmenters</i>: These fabrials are crafted to enhance something. They can create heat, pain, or even a calm wind, for instance. They are powered—like <span aria-label="1225" id="pg_1225" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>all fabrials—by Stormlight. They seem to work best with forces, emotions, or sensations.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The so-called half-shards of Jah Keved are created with this type of fabrial attached to a sheet of metal, enhancing its durability. I have seen fabrials of this type crafted using many different kinds of gemstone; I am guessing that any one of the ten Polestones will work.</p>
<p class="sb2-top"><i class="calibre6">Diminishers</i>: These fabrials do the opposite of what augmenters do, and generally seem to fall under the same restrictions as their cousins. Those artifabrians who have taken me into confidence seem to believe that even greater fabrials are possible than what have been created so far, particularly in regard to augmenters and diminishers.</p>
</section>
<section type="division">
<h2 class="bmh"><small class="calibre8">PAIRING FABRIALS</small></h2>
<p class="stni"><i class="calibre6">Conjoiners</i>: By infusing a ruby and using methodology that has not been revealed to me (though I have my suspicions), you can create a conjoined pair of gemstones. The process requires splitting the original ruby. The two halves will then create parallel reactions across a distance. Spanreeds are one of the most common forms of this type of fabrial.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Conservation of force is maintained; for instance, if one is attached to a heavy stone, you will need the same strength to lift the conjoined fabrial that you would need to lift the stone itself. There appears to be some sort of process used during the creation of the fabrial that influences how far apart the two halves can go and still produce an effect.</p>
<p class="sb2-top"><i class="calibre6">Reversers</i>: Using an amethyst instead of a ruby also creates conjoined halves of a gemstone, but these two work in creating <i class="calibre6">opposite</i> reactions. Raise one, and the other will be pressed downward, for instance.</p>
<p class="fmtx">These fabrials have only just been discovered, and already the possibilities for exploitation are being conjectured. There appear to be some unexpected limitations to this form of fabrial, though I have not been able to discover what they are.</p>
</section>
<section type="division">
<h2 class="bmh"><small class="calibre8">WARNING FABRIALS</small></h2>
<p class="tni">There is only one type of fabrial in this set, informally known as the Alerter. An Alerter can warn one of a nearby object, feeling, sensation, or phenomenon. These fabrials use a heliodor stone as their focus. I do not know whether this is the only type of gemstone that will work, or if there is another reason heliodor is used.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1226" id="pg_1226" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>In the case of this kind of fabrial, the amount of Stormlight you can infuse into it affects its range. Hence the size of gemstone used is very important.</p>

<h2 class="bmsh"><span class="esans_tresillian_script_bold_b_">WINDRUNNING AND LASHINGS</span></h2>
<p class="tni">Reports of the Assassin in White’s odd abilities have led me to some sources of information that, I believe, are generally unknown. The Windrunners were an order of the Knights Radiant, and they made use of two primary types of Surgebinding. The effects of these Surgebindings were known—colloquially among the members of the order—as the Three Lashings.</p>
</section>
<section type="division">
<h2 class="bmh"><small class="calibre8">BASIC LASHING: GRAVITATIONAL CHANGE</small></h2>
<p class="tni">This type of Lashing was one of the most commonly used Lashings among the order, though it was not the easiest to use. (That distinction belongs to the Full Lashing below.) A Basic Lashing involved revoking a being’s or object’s spiritual gravitational bond to the planet below, instead temporarily linking that being or object to a different object or direction.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Effectively, this creates a change in gravitational pull, twisting the energies of the planet itself. A Basic Lashing allowed a Windrunner to run up walls, to send objects or people flying off into the air, or to create similar effects. Advanced uses of this type of Lashing would allow a Windrunner to make himself or herself lighter by binding part of his or her mass upward. (Mathematically, binding a quarter of one’s mass upward would halve a person’s effective weight. Binding half of one’s mass upward would create weightlessness.)</p>
<p class="fmtx">Multiple Basic Lashings could also pull an object or a person’s body downward at double, triple, or other multiples of its weight.</p>
</section>
<section type="division">
<h2 class="bmh"><small class="calibre8">FULL LASHING: BINDING OBJECTS TOGETHER</small></h2>
<p class="tni">A Full Lashing might seem very similar to a Basic Lashing, but they worked on very different principles. While one had to do with gravitation, the other had to do with the force (or Surge, as the Radiants called them) of Adhesion—binding objects together as if they were one. I believe this Surge may have had something to do with atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p class="fmtx">To create a Full Lashing, a Windrunner would infuse an object with Stormlight, then press another object to it. The two objects would become bound together with an extremely powerful bond, nearly impossible to <span aria-label="1227" id="pg_1227" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>break. In fact, most materials would themselves break before the bond holding them together would.</p>
</section>
<section type="division">
<h2 class="bmh"><small class="calibre8">REVERSE LASHING: GIVING AN OBJECT A GRAVITATIONAL PULL</small></h2>
<p class="tni">I believe this may actually be a specialized version of the Basic Lashing. This type of Lashing required the least amount of Stormlight of any of the three Lashings. The Windrunner would infuse something, give a mental command, and create a <i class="calibre6">pull</i> to the object that yanked other objects toward it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">At its heart, this Lashing created a bubble around the object that imitated its spiritual link to the ground beneath it. As such, it was much harder for the Lashing to affect objects touching the ground, where their link to the planet was strongest. Objects falling or in flight were the easiest to influence. Other objects could be affected, but the Stormlight and skill required were much more substantial.</p>
</section>
<section type="division">
<h2 class="bmsh"><span class="esans_tresillian_script_bold_b_">LIGHTWEAVING</span></h2>
<p class="tni">A second form of Surgebinding involves the manipulation of light and sound in illusory tactics common throughout the cosmere. Unlike the variations present on Sel, however, this method has a powerful Spiritual element, requiring not just a full mental picture of the intended creation, but some level of Connection to it as well. The illusion is based not simply upon what the Lightweaver imagines, but upon what they <i class="calibre6">desire</i> to create.</p>
<p class="fmtx">In many ways, this is the most similar ability to the original Yolish variant, which excites me. I wish to delve more into this ability, with the hope to gain a full understanding of how it relates to cognitive and spiritual attributes.</p>
</section>
<section type="division">
<h2 class="bmsh"><span class="esans_tresillian_script_bold_b_">SOULCASTING</span></h2>
<p class="tni">Essential to the economy of Roshar is the art of Soulcasting, in which one form of matter is directly transformed into another by changing its spiritual nature. This is performed on Roshar via the use of devices known as Soulcasters, and these devices (the majority of which appear to be focused on turning stone into grain or flesh) are used to provide mobile supply for armies or to augment local urban food stores. This has allowed kingdoms on Roshar—where fresh water is rarely an issue, because of highstorm rains—to field armies in ways that would be unthinkable elsewhere.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1228" id="pg_1228" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>What intrigues me most about Soulcasting, however, are the things we can infer about the world and Investiture from it. For example, certain gemstones are requisite in producing certain results—if you wish to produce grain, your Soulcaster must both be attuned to that transformation <i class="calibre6">and</i> have an emerald (not a different gemstone) attached. This creates an economy based on the relative values of what the gemstones can create, not upon their rarity. Indeed, as the chemical structures are identical for several of these gemstone varieties, aside from trace impurities, the <i class="calibre6">color</i> is the most important part—not their actual axial makeup. I’m certain you will find this relevance of hue quite intriguing, particularly in its relationship to other forms of Investiture.</p>
<p class="fmtx">This relationship must have been essential in the local creation of the table I’ve included above, which lacks some scientific merit, but is intrinsically tied to the folklore surrounding Soulcasting. An emerald can be used to create food—and thus is traditionally associated with a similar Essence. Indeed, on Roshar there are considered to be ten elements; not the traditional four or sixteen, depending upon local tradition.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Curiously, these gemstones seem tied to the original abilities of the Soulcasters who were an order of Knights Radiant—but they don’t seem <i class="calibre6">essential</i> to the actual operation of the Investiture when performed by a living Radiant. I do not know the connection here, though it implies something valuable.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Soulcasters, the devices, were created to <i class="calibre6">imitate</i> the abilities of the Surge of Soulcasting (or Transformation). This is yet <i class="calibre6">another</i> mechanical imitation of something once available only to a select few within the bounds of an Invested Art. The Honorblades on Roshar, indeed, may be the very first example of this—from thousands of years ago. I believe this has relevance to the discoveries being made on Scadrial, and the commoditization of Allomancy and Feruchemy.</p>

<h2 class="bmsh"><span class="esans_tresillian_script_bold_b_">STONESHAPING</span></h2>
<p class="tni">As I’ve had further occasion to study the use of Investiture on Roshar, and the curious manifestation of it known as Surgebinding, I’ve found occasion to ruminate further on the nature of Intent and Connection.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The power known as Stoneshaping, as practiced by the orders of Stonewards and Willshapers, is an excellent example of this. This ability manipulates the Surge of Cohesion, and is in many ways a cousin to the axial manipulation known as microkinesis—as both grant the ability to manipulate the forces that bind individual axi together. Fortunately, in my <span aria-label="1229" id="pg_1229" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>explorations, it appears that Stoneshaping is far less … explosive of a power, bounded by the rules that Honor placed upon it to protect from the mistakes that happened on Yolen.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Nevertheless, a practiced Stoneward or Willshaper can mold stone as if it were clay, weakening the bonds between axi. (Indeed, this can be done to other materials as well, I’m led to believe, but stone is the easiest and most common application.) This is not simply a chemical process. Normally, one might expect heat to be involved to excite the axi, but this is not the case. Indeed, it is the Intent of the user that is relevant here.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The stone senses the desire of the Stoneward, and the practitioner is able to shape it through desire as much as through physical force. I don’t believe I properly understood the way Investiture responds to the conscious Intent of the user until I read of the interactions of spren and sapient beings on Roshar. There is so much to learn here and so much to explore.</p>
<p class="fmtx">I have sent my best agent to embed among the Stonewards. His research has been most illuminating. It suggests there are three ways we can look at the nature of Intent as it relates to Stoneshaping.</p>
<p class="sb2-top"><i class="calibre6">Willingness</i>: Stone seems to be uniformly willing to obey the commands of a Surgebinder attuned to Cohesion. This is curious, as stone is often among the most difficult of materials to work with in Soulcasting—even more difficult than living beings, depending on those beings’ emotional, mental, and spiritual states.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Why is stone so eager to change for a Stoneward or Willshaper? What about it makes it so likely to respond to their desires, to incorporate them, and to enjoy the result? Like a willing audience at a comedy, the stone lets the Surgebinder guide it.</p>
<p class="sb2-top"><i class="calibre6">Connection</i>: The stone can sense the Intent of the Surgebinder, and even their past. I have reliable reports of stone reaching back through generations of Connection to display events, feelings, emotions, and ideas from long ago. It will shape the faces of Stonewards long dead. It will create pictures of events long forgotten. What I initially dismissed as an inferior form of microkinesis is, indeed, much more focused and—in some ways—more remarkable. There is a divining property to Stoneshaping I had not thought to find.</p>
<p class="sb2-top"><i class="calibre6">Command</i>: The Stoneshaper must often make a Command, mental or verbal, to truly control the stone. This is much like many other arcana around the cosmere, and is in itself not that novel. However, I find electrifying the news out of the mountains of Ur, that their current queen seems to have <span aria-label="1230" id="pg_1230" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>been able to Command the creation of an anti-Investiture. Long theorized, this will be my first true evidence it is possible—and can only be created through Intent.</p>
<p class="fmtx">I think that perhaps Foil, deep within his ocean, would find this information supports my theories over his. And he’d do well to listen to me on this matter if he ever wishes to achieve control over the aethers, as he has insisted is his goal.</p>
