<p class="lti"><span aria-label="415" id="pg_415" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">I do not share their attitude. If you can, as you suppose, maintain Odium’s prison for now, it would give us necessary time to plan. This is a threat beyond the capacity of one Shard to face.</span></p>
<p class="tni">Even weeks after first meeting one, Venli caught herself staring at the new brand of Fused.</p>
<p class="fmtx">These ones—called the <i class="calibre6">makay-im,</i> or “Those Ones of the Depths”—had access to one of her same Surges: the ability to turn stone into a liquid.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Deepest Ones had smooth skin, no hair, and barely any carapace—just shells over their heads and genitals. This put their vibrant patterns on display across the full lengths of their sinuous bodies. Long-legged and long-armed, they reminded Venli of her current form, which was tall without reaching the unnatural willowy level of Raboniel and the builders like her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The <i class="calibre6">makay-im</i> wore open-fronted robes, if they wore anything at all. They stayed aloof from the rest of the strike team as they moved through the frozen mountain passes. After weeks of traveling together, Venli still hadn’t been addressed directly by one of the Deepest Ones—though the pace Raboniel set left little time for chitchat.</p>
<p class="fmtx">These mountains, as far as Venli could tell, weren’t claimed by any particular kingdom. The isolated valleys were too inaccessible from the outside. Her team had been dropped in by Heavenly Ones several weeks before, then left to travel the rest of the way to Urithiru on foot.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The human fortress lay somewhere in here—presumed hidden and unassailable. Windrunner patrols made it impossible to fly in too close, but Raboniel felt that a small group of ground troops—moving carefully at <span aria-label="416" id="pg_416" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>night or during storms—would be able to approach the lower tunnels to the tower unseen.</p>
<p class="fmtx">So it was that Venli joined the rest of the group in moving out from the shadow of tree cover, crossing the stone ground. As on other days, Raboniel set a characteristically difficult pace, though Venli knew she wouldn’t start to feel tired until they’d been going for a few hours.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The ancient scholar had changed from stately robes into travel leathers suitable for battle, her topknot of pure red-orange hairstrands spilling down around her otherwise carapace-covered skull. She urged the group forward, increasingly eager. They were nearing the tower; only a few days now.</p>
<p class="fmtx">This highland valley was mostly barren, supporting just the most rugged of rockbuds and the occasional clump of squat trees, their branches interwoven to create a storm-resistant snarl. Though leaves on these trees would retract before storms, the branches remained firm and interlocked. There wasn’t a single lifespren in sight, though coldspren lined the ground, pointing toward the sky.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As one might expect, there were more rockbuds on the leeward slopes, but blasted scars of black ground and burned patches showed that when the Everstorm came through, it did not temper its fury. The heights seemed to suffer more lightning strikes than the lowlands did.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She hiked more quickly to pass the soldiers and position herself next to the Deepest Ones. She liked watching them, because they <i class="calibre6">melded</i> with the stone, even as they moved. The bright azure light of Honor’s Moon revealed thirty figures, some in rippling robes, <i class="calibre6">sliding</i> across the ground while standing. It wasn’t quite like the <i class="calibre6">shetel-im,</i> the Flowing Ones, who could slide across any surface as if it were slick. This was something different. The Deepest Ones stood with their feet sunken <i class="calibre6">into</i> the ground up past their ankles.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They moved like nothing Venli had ever seen. Like sticks in a current following a powerful highstorm, as if the stone were pushing them along while they stood perfectly still. Their eyes glowed red—like those of all Fused and Regals—but theirs seemed a more sinister, dark shade.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They interest you, I’ve noticed,” a voice said from Venli’s side.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She jumped, and turned to find Raboniel walking alongside her. Venli attuned Anxiety, and Timbre thrummed within her, worried. Had she been paying too much attention? Would it be seen as suspicious? She lowered her head and hummed to Agony. Already she worried this mission risked exposing her bond.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No need to be ashamed,” Raboniel said to Conceit. “Curiosity is welcome in singers. It is a worthy Passion, Last Listener.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli held Anxiety as she walked—at a swift hike—beneath Raboniel’s <span aria-label="417" id="pg_417" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>gaze. She intended to serve this Fused well, as Leshwi had asked. Of the staff, only Venli was Regal, so only she could make this difficult trip. So far, she had served the femalen in quiet capacities: setting out her bedroll at night, fetching water for her to drink. She hadn’t been given many other duties, and had barely been addressed. She’d begun to think that serving Raboniel would be—if not easy—at least uneventful. Why was she now drawing the femalen’s attention?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You are such an odd choice by Leshwi,” Raboniel said. “When I discovered just <i class="calibre6">who</i> had been given as my new Voice … To so many, you are merely the child of traitors. Yet Leshwi gave you honor. Named you Last Listener.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“She was kind, Ancient One.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“She thinks highly of you,” Raboniel said. “Fused are not kind; they reward competence and Passion. Even if one is the daughter of traitors. I should have expected Leshwi’s Voice to be someone … irregular. She is among the most clever and capable of the Heavenly Ones.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“She … might dispute that, Ancient One.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, I realize how much work she does to make others underestimate her.” Raboniel said it to Satisfaction. “She is dangerous, and that is good.” She looked to Venli and blinked her red eyes once, humming softly to Satisfaction.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre thrummed within Venli. Raboniel knew too much. She’d plainly discerned that Venli was a spy for Leshwi. But how much more had Raboniel figured out? Surely she didn’t know the full truth.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Tell me,” Raboniel said. “What about the Deepest Ones interests you so? Why do you spend hours staring at them?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I find their powers fascinating,” Venli said—best not to lie until she had to.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Nine brands of Fused,” Raboniel said. “Nine Surges. You know of the Surges?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The innate forces by which all life, all <i class="calibre6">reality,</i> are connected. Gravitation. Transportation. Transformation. But … I thought there were ten?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That is human talk,” Raboniel said to Derision. “They claim a tenth, of Honor alone. Adhesion is not a true Surge, but a lie that was presented to us as one. True Surges are of both Honor <i class="calibre6">and</i> Cultivation—Cultivation for life, Honor to make the Surge into natural law. Things must fall to the ground, so they created Surges to make it happen.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And the Surge of these ones?” Venli asked, gesturing toward the Deepest Ones.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Cohesion,” Raboniel said. “The Surge of Axial Connection—the Surge that binds the smallest pieces of all objects to one another. The Surge that holds us together. The <i class="calibre6">makay-im</i> can meld their essence into the essences <span aria-label="418" id="pg_418" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>of other things, intermingling their axi. All things are mostly emptiness, though we cannot see that it is so. A stone, like a mind, exists to be filled by thought and Investiture.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli hummed to Craving. Answers. Finally, <i class="calibre6">answers.</i> She didn’t know what half of any of this meant, but to have one of the Fused answer so easily … It excited her, though Timbre thrummed to Caution.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The Radiants each have two Surges,” Venli said. “The Fused each have one. So are the Radiants more powerful?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Powerful? Is it better to have more abilities, or to have one ability handled expertly? We of the Fused know our Surge with an intimacy a Radiant will never know. Humans. They were not created for this world, these Surges, or the storms. Light leaks from humans like water through fingers. They get flares of great power, but cannot <i class="calibre6">hold</i> what they have.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“One of the Fused can contain Light and bask in it indefinitely. Even a Regal such as you knows this power in a lesser way—most don’t know it, but you contain a small amount of Voidlight in your gemheart. You can’t use it actively, of course, but you might have felt it enflaming your emotions.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“As for Fused, our dominance over our Surge is eternal. Where humans visit, we reign.” She gestured toward the Deepest Ones. “Can any Radiant claim to know the stones as these do, melding with rock, mixing their very axi? Radiants are so outwardly focused. They change the world, but ignore themselves. Yes, a Radiant can cast a stone into the sky, but the <i class="calibre6">shanay-im</i> can soar without worry of ever dropping.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli hummed to Craving, though she wasn’t certain she agreed. Although she had been timid about using her Radiant powers in Kholinar, they excited her. Timbre said that she would be able to move stone, shape it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She glanced at the Deepest Ones, who moved so quietly, so smoothly. Next to them, Venli’s own hiking gait—and that of the five hundred stormform soldiers marching behind—felt awkward. And she did feel envy at the way they flowed. So … <i class="calibre6">why</i> was it that the powers manifested differently in Radiants than they did in Fused?</p>
<p class="fmtx">She attuned Annoyance as she considered what Raboniel had said. Each answer seemed to give rise to a dozen new questions, but Venli knew that the Fused—even one that was in an accommodating mood like Raboniel—would not suffer questions forever. So, Venli settled on one last thing to ask.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“If Surges are from Honor and Cultivation,” she said, “then why do we serve Odium?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A dangerous question,” Raboniel said to Derision. “You truly are the daughter of traitors, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="419" id="pg_419" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Don’t cover up your ambition, child,” Raboniel said, leading Venli past a line of snarled shrubs, with little furry creatures scampering underneath in the night. “I like it in my servants. Still, there is a certain silliness to your question. Which would you rather worship? A god of plants? Or a god of emotions?” She waved to the southeast. “Cultivation hides in these mountains somewhere. She is everywhere, but she is also here. Alive, but frightened. She knows. She is not a god of <i class="calibre6">people,</i> but of <i class="calibre6">creatures.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“And Honor? A god of laws? Again, which would you prefer? A god who knows only how to make a rock fall to the ground? Or a god who knows us, understands us, <i class="calibre6">feels</i> as we do? Yes, Surges are bound by Honor. Yet as you can see, his death did not change the world in any appreciable manner. His power binds all things together, but this alone is not worthy of worship. Odium … Passion … <i class="calibre6">he</i> will grant rewards.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli hummed to Craving.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You want more, don’t you?” Raboniel said. “Only one with pure ambition would stand where you do now. Serve well, and you may find the blessings available to the worthy. True knowledge. True life.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli continued to hum, though her internal rhythm was something far more uncertain. The Rhythm of the Lost. She didn’t know what to make of Raboniel. Many Fused were some variety of unhinged: vengeful, destructive, conceited.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Listening to this creature’s careful, insightful offers, Venli found herself afraid. This creature was far more dangerous than any she’d encountered before.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel left, striding forward alongside the silent drifting figures of the Deepest Ones. Venli continued walking, and was surprised when Rothan worked his way up beside her. He was head of Lady Leshwi’s soldiers—not part of Venli’s staff, but analogous to her in authority. He, like most of Leshwi’s soldiers, had been given to Raboniel for this incursion.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The soldiers of the Pursuer had also joined them—and they were a group Venli knew by their fearsome reputation. They’d been harsh to the humans of Kholinar, but were among the strongest and proudest singer troops, with distinctive uniforms always worn with pride. Now those intermingled with Leshwi’s carefully trained and calmer troops, forming a powerful strike force with both strength and discipline.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli hadn’t interacted much with Rothan or the other soldiers, but she had nothing against him. Other than the fact that other Regals made her worried, as they held Voidspren in their gemhearts. With each step, his powerful figure seemed to crackle with energy. Sparks occasionally flashed across his deep red eyes. She remembered that feeling, holding stormform. The form she’d used when she’d led her people to their doom.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="420" id="pg_420" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“You should not bother the Fused, Venli,” Rothan said to Derision, looking toward Raboniel. “Most are not as lenient as Leshwi. Take care. I would not see you fall. You are useful to us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I … hadn’t noticed that you cared,” she said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Leshwi values you,” he said. “Therefore, so do the rest of us.” He left her with that simple warning as he retreated. Rothan didn’t often want answers or even engagement. He simply stood tall, spoke his mind, then expected to be understood.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">He would be a good one to have on my side,</i> Venli thought. But no, too dangerous. Far too dangerous. She couldn’t afford to think about recruitment right now. She had to focus on staying alive. For, as grueling as this hike through the mountains had been, she knew a more dangerous part was coming.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Within the week, they would arrive at Urithiru. And then the real test would come.</p>
