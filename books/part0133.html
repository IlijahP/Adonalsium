<p class="lti"><span aria-label="990" id="pg_990" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">Regardless, I write now. Because I know they are coming for me. They got Jezrien. They’ll inevitably claim me, even here in the honorspren stronghold.</span></p>
<p class="tni">Adolin stepped onto his podium at the honorspren forum. The circular disc had been pulled out to the center of the arena. Today, he would have the stage all to himself.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He’d arrived early, so he wouldn’t have to push his way through the crowd. He wanted to appear in control, awaiting their scorn rather than taking the long walk down the steps with everyone watching. One felt like the action of a man who had orchestrated his situation. The other felt like a prisoner being led to execution.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan and Pattern seated themselves as others began to arrive. The forum could hold a couple hundred spren, and as the honorspren—all glowing faintly white-blue—settled, he noted that far more of them wore uniforms today. The ones who had seemed sympathetic to Notum’s proclamation were conspicuously absent from the seats. Adolin found that frustrating, though he did notice some spren from yesterday crowding around the top, where they could stand and watch.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The honorspren seemed determined to seed the seated positions with those who were predisposed against him. <i class="calibre6">No reason to sweat,</i> Adolin thought, standing with his hands clasped behind his back. <i class="calibre6">It’s just your one chance to speak for yourself. Your one chance to turn all this around.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Ideally, this would be the day that went best for him. He could explain his case and answer questions from the audience. Kelek’s words from the day before weighed heavily upon him; this wasn’t merely about the honor<span aria-label="991" id="pg_991" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>spren and whether some would join the Windrunners. It was a much larger argument.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Was humankind worth fighting for? Adolin somehow had to make that argument today. Blended had warned him he’d need to fend off questions and keep the argument on topic. He couldn’t afford to engage the crowd too directly, couldn’t afford to let them control the conversation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That done, the trial would convene for one final meeting, where the honorspren could present a single last witness, whom Adolin could question, to rebut his arguments.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He bowed to Kelek as the Herald arrived. He’d changed into official-looking violet robes, a marked difference from yesterday. Did that mean he was taking this more seriously?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin waited respectfully for the High Judge to seat himself among the group of honorspren officials. Adolin had learned that six of them were among the “ten honored by storms.” The ten oldest existing honorspren, other than Syl. Hierarchy was important to this group.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“All right,” Kelek said. “Let’s get this over with. You may speak.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Thank you, Honored One,” Adolin said, then turned toward the crowd. “I don’t think my words today will surprise anyone. Yet I’ve staked my future on the opportunity to say them to you. In person. To look you in the eyes, and ask you if you <i class="calibre6">truly</i> think this is justice.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Men hold grudges. It is one of our greatest failings. Sometimes families will continue a cycle of hatred for generations, all for some slight that no one remembers. While I won’t compare your very real pain and betrayal to something so insignificant, I hope to find in you—immortal pieces of Honor—a more perfect way of—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Did you know,” a spren in the front row interrupted, “that your father almost killed the Stormfather?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin stumbled in his speech. “I will answer questions at the end,” he said. “As I was saying, I had hoped to find—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Did you know about it?” the honorspren demanded, shouting. “Did you know he <i class="calibre6">almost killed the Stormfather</i>?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I find that difficult to believe,” Adolin said. He glanced up at the top of the forum, where the standing spren were shuffling and whispering to one another. The audience fell quiet, waiting for Adolin. A question had been asked, but he didn’t have to answer it, not yet. He controlled the floor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">So he remained focused as Blended had taught him, then purposefully continued his statement. “In <i class="calibre6">you,</i>” Adolin said to the crowd, “I had hoped to find <i class="calibre6">honor.</i> Ancient spren bonded with us because they believed that together, we became something stronger, something <i class="calibre6">better</i> than we were alone.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I admit to human weakness. I will not hide it. But I have not seen you <span aria-label="992" id="pg_992" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>admit to <i class="calibre6">your</i> weakness. You claim to be creations of honor. That you are better than men. Yet you refuse to prove it, to show it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I know of spren who do. Brave spren, who have come to the battle to join with men. In so doing, they have become <i class="calibre6">stronger.</i> They grow, like the people who bond them. Why do we need Radiants? Because they represent our best selves. We are of Honor and Cultivation. Honor, for an ideal. Cultivation, for the power to reach <i class="calibre6">toward</i> that ideal.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The Stormfather himself agrees that this is the correct choice. People may not be perfect, but they’re worth helping strive <i class="calibre6">for</i> perfection. And <i class="calibre6">you</i> are worth more than you can ever be sitting alone and refusing to grow.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">That went over well. The honorspren liked a good speech, he’d learned—and those at the top in particular seemed swayed. He took a breath, preparing to move to his next point. Unfortunately, in the pause, that same honorspren from before leaped to his feet.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The Stormfather made his choice,” the spren said loudly, “and in so doing, put himself in danger—he nearly died. Did you <i class="calibre6">know about this</i>?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kelek leaned forward in his judge’s seat. That was dangerously close to a statement, which the audience was not allowed to make. Trial by witness allowed Adolin to make declarations, but the audience could only question.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I did not know of this event,” Adolin told the spren. “So I cannot offer insight into why it happened, or what the circumstances were.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How could you not know?” a different spren, in the second row, demanded. “If you’ve come to persuade us to become Radiant spren, shouldn’t you know the cost of what you’re asking? I think—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Enough of that,” Kelek snapped. “Do you want to be ejected, Veratorim?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The spren quieted immediately.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Proceed, human,” Kelek said, settling back and lacing his fingers before himself.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My second argument,” Adolin said, “is to show to you that the kingdoms of the world have put aside their differences to unite together to face this challenge. I brought a letter from my cousin, Jasnah, which was torn up. Fortunately, I can quote parts to you. She proves that the modern kingdoms are—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Has she tried to kill <i class="calibre6">her</i> spren?” the spren in the first row asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“She proves,” Adolin continued, “that our modern kingdoms are united in ways that—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, but has she tried to kill her spren?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Look,” Adolin snapped, “do you want me to talk or not? Do you want to hear my testimony, like you’ve offered, or do you just want to take shots at me?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="993" id="pg_993" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The spren smiled. And Adolin realized what he’d done. By asking a question, Adolin had invited an answer.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I think,” the spren said, standing up, “that the most relevant question is if these new Radiants can be trusted. <i class="calibre6">That’s</i> what you need to prove. The Stormfather <i class="calibre6">told</i> us that Dalinar Kholin forced him to physically manifest. Dalinar Kholin, your father, using the <i class="calibre6">Stormfather’s essence</i> to work one of the Oathgates!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That’s against his oath!” another one exclaimed. “Did you know about your father’s actions?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m sure he had good reasons,” Adolin said. “If you would—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Good reasons?” the standing honorspren said. “He was <i class="calibre6">running away.</i> Does this seem like the kind of behavior we should trust in a Bondsmith? From the man <i class="calibre6">you</i> said was ideal, that <i class="calibre6">you</i> promised would never betray us. How do you respond to this?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin looked to Kelek. “Can I please continue my witness?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You invited this discussion, son,” Kelek said. “You need to engage him now.” Kelek nodded toward the crowd at the top of the forum. Those who had joined with Notum yesterday waited quietly, wanting answers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin sighed, glancing to Shallan for strength before continuing. “I cannot speak for my father. You’ll have to ask him. I trust him; the Stormfather trusts him; that should be enough.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He is a walking disaster,” the spren said. “He is a murderer by his own testimony. This is <i class="calibre6">no</i> Bondsmith.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin ignored that, as it wasn’t a question. And theoretically, he could let this subject die and continue.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Jasnah’s letter,” he began, “is—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Kaladin Stormblessed almost killed <i class="calibre6">his</i> spren too,” a completely different honorspren said. “The Ancient Daughter, most precious of children. Did you know that?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin ground his teeth. “I do know what happened between Kaladin and Syl. It was a difficult time for all of us, a point of transition. Kaladin didn’t know he was breaking his oaths—he was merely having a difficult time navigating conflicting loyalties.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So you’re ignorant <i class="calibre6">and</i> dangerous,” the spren in the second row said. “Your Radiants barely know what they’re doing! You could kill your spren by accident!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kelek waved, and the spren was grabbed by attendants and carried up and out of the forum. But Adolin saw this for what it was. A coordinated attack, and the ejection a calculated risk to get the words out.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’re <i class="calibre6">not</i> killing our spren,” Adolin said to the crowd. “These incidents are isolated, and we don’t have proper context to discuss them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="994" id="pg_994" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Is that so?” yet another honorspren said. “You can <i class="calibre6">swear</i> that none of your Radiants have killed their spren?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes! None of them have. They…” He trailed off.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Damnation. He’d met one, hadn’t he? Killed recently—that Cryptic in the market.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They what?” the spren demanded.</p>
<p class="fmtx">If he answered the question truthfully, it could be the end. Adolin took a deep breath, and did what Blended had warned him against. He engaged the audience. “I could answer, but you don’t care, do you? You obviously planned together how to attack me today. This is an ambush. You don’t care about honor, and you don’t care what I have to say. You simply want to throw things at me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He stepped forward and lifted his hands to the sides. “All right. Go ahead! But know this! You say that spren don’t lie, that spren are not changeable like men? Next time you try to pretend that is true, remember this day! Remember how you lied when you said I’d have a fair trial. Remember how you treated the man who came to you in good faith!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The crowd fell silent. Even his most vocal challengers sat.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You were warned about this trial multiple times, human,” Kelek said from behind. “They have made their choice.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not all of them,” Adolin said. “I <i class="calibre6">thought</i> I’d find rational people inside these gates. Honorable spren. But you know what? I’m happy I didn’t. Because now I know you for what you are. You’re people, like any of us. Some of you are scared. It makes you afraid to commit. It makes you consider things you would once have thought irrational.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I understand that. I am <i class="calibre6">glad</i> to find you are like humans, because I know what it means. It means you question—that you’re afraid, you’re uncertain. Believe me, I feel these things too. But you can’t sit here and pretend that all humans are the same, that all humans deserve to be thrown away, when you yourselves are as flawed as we are. This trial proves it. Your hearts prove it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He stared out at them. Daring them. Challenging them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Finally, looking uncomfortable, the spren in the first row cleared his throat and stood. “Did you know—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Oh, cut the act,” Adolin said to him. “You want to continue this farce? Fine. Do what you’re going to do. I’ll make it legal and ask—what is it you’ve <i class="calibre6">obviously</i> planned next to try to discredit me?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The spren searched about the audience, uncertain. “I … Well, did you know about this?” He waved toward the top of the forum. The spren there parted, and everyone turned, looking up at someone being led down the steps by Amuna, the limber honorspren who kept the deadeyes. Today she led a Cryptic—one with a broken pattern, the head wilted.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="995" id="pg_995" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Damnation. It was as he’d feared.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Do you know this Cryptic?” Amuna demanded from the steps.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“If it’s the same one I saw when I first landed on these shores,” Adolin said, “then no. I just saw them once, in the market where the caravans cross.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You know her story?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I … Yes, I was told it by a shopkeeper.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“She was killed only a few years ago,” Amuna said. “This is proof of your lies. Modern Radiants cannot be trusted.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“There is no evidence that a Radiant did this,” Adolin said. “We encountered humans—who have nothing to do with my people—who attacked Notum. Perhaps <i class="calibre6">they</i> attacked her.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That kind of attack leaves a spren who can eventually be healed, with enough Stormlight,” Amuna said. “The only <i class="calibre6">true</i> death for a spren—the only way to create a deadeye—is through broken Radiant oaths.” Amuna gestured toward the deadeye. “This Cryptic didn’t fall during the days of the Recreance. She was killed less than a decade ago. By one of your Radiants.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Likely someone new, untested,” Adolin said. “Someone we don’t know about. Not one of ours; a poor new Radiant who didn’t understand what they were doing. If you’d simply…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">But he knew he’d lost them. The crowds shifted, pulling away from the Cryptic, scooting in their seats. Another spren from the first row stood up and shouted questions at Adolin, joined by a dozen others, their words piling atop one another. How many spren would have to die before he admitted Radiants were a bad idea? Did he know the old Radiants had killed their spren because they worried about something <i class="calibre6">more</i> dangerous?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin lowered his arms before the assault. Blended had tried to prepare him as best she could, but Adolin was no expert in legal defenses. He’d let himself be maneuvered, like being backed into unfavorable footing in a duel.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The reveal of the Cryptic overshadowed anything else he might say, any other arguments he could make. He looked to Kelek, who nodded, then gestured for him to go. Angry questions battered Adolin as he walked up the steps with as much dignity as he could manage. He knew when a duel was rigged. They’d been <i class="calibre6">telling</i> him from the beginning that it would be. And still he’d believed he could convince them.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Idiot.</i></p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Some hours after Adolin’s second day of trial, Shallan closed her eyes, resting her head against his bare chest, listening to his heartbeat.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="996" id="pg_996" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She would never have thought she’d find that sound so comforting. For most of her life, she’d never considered what it would mean to be this close to someone. It would have been alien for her to imagine the blissful warmth of skin against skin, her safehand reaching alongside his face, fingers curled into his hair. How could she possibly have anticipated the wonderful intimacy of feeling his breath on her hair, of listening to his heartbeat, louder to her than her own. The rhythm of his life.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lying there, everything seemed—for a moment—perfect.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin rested his arm across her bare back. The room was dark, their drapes drawn closed. She wasn’t accustomed to darkness; usually you had a chip sitting out to give at least a little light. But here they had no spheres.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Except what she had hidden in the trunk. Sequestered with the cube that spoke between realms. And a very special knife.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I love you,” Adolin whispered in the dark. “What did I do to deserve you?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Blaspheme, perhaps,” she said. “Or play pranks on your brother. I’m not sure what a person might do to make the Almighty curse them with me. Perhaps you were simply too slow to run away.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He trailed his hand up her bare spine, making her shiver as he finally rested it on the back of her head. “You’re brilliant,” he whispered. “Determined. Funny.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Sometimes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Sometimes,” he admitted, and she could hear the smile on his lips. “But always beautiful.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He thought that. He actually did. She tried to believe she deserved it, but it was difficult. She was so wrapped up in lies, she literally didn’t know who she was anymore.</p>
<p class="fmtx">What if he found out? What if he knew what she <i class="calibre6">really</i> was?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your terrible taste in women,” Shallan whispered, “is one of the things I love most about you.” She pressed her head to his chest again, feeling the blond hairs tickle her cheek. “And I do love you. That’s the only thing I’ve figured out about my life.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“After today, I have to agree with you on this trial idea of mine. It was a terrible plan.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’d be the world’s biggest hypocrite if I couldn’t love you despite your occasional stupid idea.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He rubbed the back of her head through her hair. “They’re going to imprison me,” he said. “They’re already building the cell. I will be a symbol to them, a display for other spren to come and see.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ll break you out,” Shallan said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I stole some Stormlight,” she said. “I’ll grab my agents and Godeke, <span aria-label="997" id="pg_997" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>and we’ll stage a rescue. I doubt the honorspren will give chase; they’re too paranoid for that.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin breathed out in the darkness.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not going to forbid me?” Shallan asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I … don’t know,” he said. “There are some here who want to listen to me, Shallan. Some I can persuade. But they’re afraid of dying, and I find myself uncertain. Not everyone is suited to war, and that’s what I’m recruiting them for. I can’t truthfully promise them they’ll live, that their Radiants won’t betray them. Maybe it’s not right to demand they join us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Kelek told you their leaders were considering going to the enemy’s side,” Shallan said. “If that happens, those spren will end up bonding people anyway, regardless of what they think now. And the people they’ll bond aren’t the type to worry about the safety of their spren.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“True,” Adolin said. “Storms, I wish I could get through to everyone here. Maybe tomorrow. I have a chance to rebut their witness, ask my own questions.…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Adolin? You said this is a terrible plan. Will the last day change that?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Maybe not,” he said. “But at least it’s a terrible plan that lets me engage with them. It lets them see a human trying to be honorable. Even if he’s terrible at it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re not terrible at being honorable.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He grimaced. “Someone smarter could have won this,” he said softly. “Jasnah could have made them see. Instead it’s just me. I wish … I wish I <i class="calibre6">knew,</i> Shallan. What to do. How to make them see.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She squeezed her eyes shut, attempting to return to that earlier moment of perfection. She couldn’t. There was too much pain in his voice. His heartbeat had sped up. His breathing no longer felt serene to her, but frustrated.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It tore her apart to hear him like this. This was the man who had kept them all together when Kholinar fell, the man who was normally so optimistic. He’d come here determined to prove to his father—and maybe to himself—that he was still valuable. This stupid trial was going to take that from him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Unless.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No,</i> Radiant thought. <i class="calibre6">We can’t fulfill Mraize’s plan. He’s manipulating you.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We do what two of us agree to,</i> Shallan said. <i class="calibre6">And I agree it is time to do as Mraize wants. We will take Kelek’s soul, and we will imitate him at the trial. Veil and I will—</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No,</i> Veil thought.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan’s breath caught. What?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I change my mind,</i> Veil said. <i class="calibre6">I side with Radiant. I will</i> not <i class="calibre6">go kill Kelek. Two against one, Shallan.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="998" id="pg_998" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Something stirred deep inside of Shallan.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I…” Adolin whispered. “I wish I could find out who killed that poor Cryptic. That’s what ruined it today. Ruined it all.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">It is time.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“This trial is not ruined,” Formless said to Adolin. “You know, the more I contemplate it, the more I think maybe this trial <i class="calibre6">wasn’t</i> such a bad idea. You’re right. At least you’re getting a chance to show them what an honorable man looks like.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“For all the good it’s doing,” Adolin said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t know,” Formless said. “The High Judge <i class="calibre6">is</i> one of the Heralds. Maybe he’ll end up surprising you.…”</p>
