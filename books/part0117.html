<p class="lti"><span aria-label="869" id="pg_869" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">Such skills, like my honor itself, are now lost to time. Weathered away, crushed to dust, and scattered to the ends of the cosmere. I am a barren tree of a human being. I am the hollow that once was a mighty peak.</span></p>
<p class="tni">The Sibling refused to speak to Navani.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She lowered her hand and stared at the garnet vein in the wall. Such a wonderful secret. In plain sight, surrounding her all this time. So common your eyes passed over it, and if you noticed it at all, you remarked only briefly. Simply another pattern in the strata.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The soul of Urithiru had been watching her all along. Perhaps if Navani had discovered it sooner, they could have achieved a different result.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She replaced her hand on the vein. “I’m sorry,” she whispered. “Please know that I’m sorry. Truly.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">For the briefest moment, she thought the Sibling would respond this time. Navani felt something, faint as the movement of a shadow deep within the ocean. No words came.</p>
<p class="fmtx">With a sigh, Navani left the crystal vein and wound her way through the shelves of the small library to reach her desk beside the door. Today, in addition to the guard, Raboniel’s daughter—with the topknot and the vacant eyes—sat on the floor right inside.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani settled onto her seat, trying to ignore the insane Fused. Notes and half-finished experiments cluttered her desk. She didn’t have the least bit of interest in continuing them. Why would she? Everything she’d attempted so far had been a sham. She wrote out her daily instructions to the <span aria-label="870" id="pg_870" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>scholars—she was having them perform tests on Voidspren fabrials, which Raboniel had delivered before everything went wrong. She gave this to a messenger, then sat there staring.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eventually Raboniel herself made an appearance, wearing an Alethi havah that fit her surprisingly well. Clearly a good dressmaker had tailored it to the Fused’s taller, more broad-shouldered frame. One might have thought her form would make her unfeminine, particularly with the unpronounced bust common to most singer femalens. Instead—with the excellent cut and the confidence of her stride—Raboniel wore the dress as if it had always been designed to accentuate someone of height, power, and poise. She had made this fashion her own. Adolin would have approved.</p>
<p class="fmtx">At least he was safe. Adolin, Renarin, Jasnah, Dalinar, and little Gav. Her entire family safe from the invasion and the mess Navani had made. It was one small blessing she could thank the Almighty for sending her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel had brought a stool—a low one, so that when she sat on it, she was at eye level with Navani. The Fused set a basket on the floor, then pulled out a bottle of burgundy wine. A Shin vintage, sweeter than traditional Alethi wines, known as an amosztha—a Shin wine made from grapes.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your journals,” Raboniel said, “indicate you are fond of this vintage.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You read my journals?” Navani said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Of course,” Raboniel said, setting out two glasses. “You would have wisely done the same in my position.” She uncorked the bottle and poured half a cup for Navani.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She didn’t drink. Raboniel didn’t force her, instead inspecting the wine with an expert eye, then taking a sip. “Ah, yes,” she said. “<i class="calibre6">That</i> is a taste infused with <i class="calibre6">memory.</i> Grapes. Your ancestors never could get them to live outside Shinovar. Too cold, I believe. Or perhaps it was the lack of soil. I found that explanation odd, as grapevines seem similar to many of our native plants.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I wasn’t there when your kind came to our world. My grandmother, however, always mentioned the smoke. At first she thought you had strange skin patterns—but that was because so many human faces had been burned or marked by soot from the destruction of the world they left behind.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“She talked about the way your livestock moaned and cried from their burns. The result of humans Surgebinding without oaths, without checks. Of course, that was before <i class="calibre6">any</i> of us understood the Surges. Before the spren left us for you, before the war started.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani felt the hair go up on the back of her neck as she listened. Storms. This creature … she had lived during the shadowdays, the time before history. They had no primary accounts of those days. Yet one sat <span aria-label="871" id="pg_871" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>before her, drinking wine from Navani’s secret stash, musing about the origins of humanity.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So long ago,” Raboniel said, with a soft, almost indistinguishable cadence to her words. “So very, very long ago. What has it been? Seven <i class="calibre6">thousand</i> years? I don’t think you can comprehend how tired I am of this war, Navani. How tired all of us are. Your Heralds too.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Then let’s end it,” Navani said. “Declare peace. Withdraw from the tower and I will convince Dalinar to engage in talks.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel turned her wine cup around, as if trying to see the liquid within from different angles. “You think talks haven’t been tried? We are born to fight one another, Navani. Opposites. At least so I thought. I always assumed that if Stormlight and Voidlight could be forced to truly mix, then … poof, they’d annihilate one another. Much as we’re doing to one another in this endless war…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Is that what this is all about?” Navani asked. “Why you want me to combine the Lights so badly?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I need to know if you’re right,” Raboniel said. “If you are, then so much of what I’ve planned will collapse. I wonder … whether sometimes I can’t see clearly anymore. Whether I assume what I <i class="calibre6">want</i> to be true <i class="calibre6">is</i> true. You live long enough, Navani, and you forget to be careful. You forget to question.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel nodded toward Navani’s desk. “No luck today?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No interest,” Navani said. “I think it is time for me to accept your initial offer and start carrying water.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Why waste yourself like that?” Raboniel asked, her rhythm becoming intense. “Navani, you <i class="calibre6">can</i> still defeat me. If it wasn’t possible for humans to outthink the Fused, you’d have fallen during the first few Returns. The first few Desolations, as you call them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Instead you always pushed us back. You fought with <i class="calibre6">stones,</i> and you beat us. My kind pretends we know so much, but during many Returns, we’d find ourselves struggling to <i class="calibre6">catch up</i> to your kind. That is our terrible secret. We hear the rhythms, we understand Roshar and the spren. But the rhythms don’t change. The spren don’t change.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“If you and I discover this secret together, you’ll be able to use it better than I will. Watch and see. At the very least, prove me wrong. <i class="calibre6">Show</i> me that our two Lights can meld and mix as you theorize.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani considered it, though storms, she knew she shouldn’t have. It was another trick—another catalyst added to the system to push the reaction forward. Yet Navani couldn’t lie to herself. She <i class="calibre6">did</i> want to know. As always, questions teased her. Questions were disorder awaiting organization. The more you understood, the more the world aligned. The more the chaos made sense, as all things should.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="872" id="pg_872" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I’ve run into a problem,” Navani said, finally taking a sip from her cup. “I can make the two Lights intersect—I can get them to pool around the same gemstone, swirling out like smoke caught in a current of air. But they won’t mix.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Opposites,” Raboniel said, leaning forward to look at the diagrams and notes Navani had made on each failed attempt.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No, merely inert substances,” Navani said. “The vast majority of elements, when combined, produce no reaction. I’d have long ago named these two things immiscible if I hadn’t seen Towerlight.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It is what gave me the original idea,” Raboniel said. “I decided if there was a hybrid between Honor’s Light and Cultivation’s, there must be a <i class="calibre6">reason</i> no one had mixed Odium’s Light with either.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Questions are the soul of science,” Navani said, sipping her wine. “But assumptions must be proven, Ancient One. From my research I believe these two aren’t opposites, but it isn’t <i class="calibre6">proven</i> to me yet.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And to prove it?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We need an emulsifier,” Navani said. “Something that causes them to mix. Unfortunately, I can’t fathom what such an emulsifier would be, though it might be related to sound. I only recently learned that Stormlight responds to tones.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes,” Raboniel said, taking a sphere off the desk. “The sounds of Roshar.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Can you hear the Light?” Navani asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel hummed—then thought to nod—her response. She held up a diamond, crystalline and pure, filled with Stormlight from the highstorm the day before. “You have to concentrate, and know what you’re seeking, to hear it from a sphere. A pure tone, extremely soft.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani hit the proper tuning fork, letting the tone ring in the room. Raboniel nodded. “Yes, that is it. Exactly the same. Only…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani sat up. “Only?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The sphere’s tone has a rhythm to it,” Raboniel explained, eyes closed as she held the sphere. “Each Light has a rhythm. Honor’s is stately. Cultivation’s is stark and staccato, but builds.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And Odium’s?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Chaos,” she said, “but with a certain strange logic to it. The longer you listen, the more sense it makes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani sat back, sipping her wine, wishing she had access to Rushu and the other scholars. Raboniel had forbidden her from drawing on their expertise in this matter, giving the problem to Navani alone. Navani, who wasn’t a scholar.</p>
<p class="fmtx">What would Jasnah do in this situation? Well, other than find a way to kill Raboniel?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="873" id="pg_873" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Navani felt the answers were right in front of her. So often, that was the case with science. The ancient humans had fought with stone weapons, but the secrets to metallurgy had been within their grasp.…</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Does Towerlight have a tone?” Navani asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Two tones,” Raboniel said, opening her eyes and setting down the Stormlight sphere. “But they aren’t simply the tones of Cultivation and of Honor. They are … different, changed so that they are in harmony with one another.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Curious,” Navani said. “And is there a rhythm to it?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes,” Raboniel said. “Both tones adopt it, harmonizing as they play the same rhythm. A symphony combining Honor’s control and Cultivation’s ever-building majesty.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Their Towerlight spheres had all run out by now, and Raboniel had no way to restore them, so there was nothing for them to check.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Plants grow by Stormlight,” Navani said, “if you beat the proper rhythm in their presence.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“An old agricultural trick,” Raboniel said. “It works better with Lifelight, if you can find some.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“<i class="calibre6">Why,</i> though?” Navani asked. “Why does Light respond to tones? Why is there a rhythm that makes plants grow?” Navani dug in her materials and began setting up an experiment.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have asked myself this question many times,” Raboniel said. “But it seems like asking why gravity pulls. Must we not accept some fundamentals of science as baselines? That some things in this world simply work?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No, we don’t have to,” Navani said. “Even gravity has a mechanism driving it. There are proofs to show why the most basic addition problems work. Everything has an explanation.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have heard,” Raboniel said, “that the Lights respond to sound because it is reminiscent of the voice of the Shards commanding them to obey.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani hit the tuning forks, touched them to their respective gemstones, then put them in place. A thin stream of Stormlight ran from one gemstone, a thin stream of Voidlight from the other. They met together at the center—swirling around an empty gemstone. Neither Light entered it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Voidlight and Stormlight,” Navani said. “The voices of gods.” Or perhaps something older than that. The reason the beings called gods spoke the way they did.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel came in close, shoulder-to-shoulder with Navani as they observed the streams of Light.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You said that Stormlight and Lifelight make a rhythm together when they mix,” she said. “So, if you could imagine a rhythm that mixed Stormlight and <i class="calibre6">Voidlight,</i> what would it be like?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="874" id="pg_874" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Those two?” Raboniel said. “It wouldn’t work, Navani. They are opposites. One orderly, organized. The other…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Her words drifted off, and her eyes narrowed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“… the other chaotic,” Raboniel whispered, “but with a <i class="calibre6">logic</i> to it. An understandable logic. Could we perhaps contrast it? Chaos always seems more powerful when displayed against an organized background.…” Finally she pursed her lips. “No, I cannot imagine it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani tapped the rim of her cup, inspecting the failed experiment.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“If you could hear the rhythms,” Raboniel said, “you’d understand. But that is beyond humans.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Sing one for me,” Navani said. “Honor’s tone and rhythm.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel complied, singing a pure, vibrant note—the tone of Stormlight, the same as made by the tuning fork. Then she made the tone waver, vibrate, pulse in a stately rhythm. Navani hummed along, matching the tone, trying to affix it into her mind. Raboniel was obviously overemphasizing the rhythm, making it easier for her to recognize.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Change now,” Navani said, “to Odium’s rhythm.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel did so, singing a discordant tone with a violent, chaotic rhythm. Navani tried to match it with Honor’s tone. She had vocal training, like any lighteyed woman of her dahn. However, it hadn’t been an area of express study for her. Though she tried to hold the tone against Raboniel’s forceful rhythm, she quickly lost the note.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel cut off, then softly hummed a different rhythm. “That was a fine attempt,” Raboniel said. “Better than I’ve heard from other humans, but we must admit you simply aren’t built for this kind of work.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani took a drink, then swirled the wine in her cup.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Why did you want me to sing those rhythms?” Raboniel asked. “What were you hoping to accomplish?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I thought that perhaps if we melded the two songs, we could find the proper harmony that would come from a combination of Stormlight and Voidlight.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It won’t be that easy,” Raboniel said. “The tones would need to change to find a harmony. I’ve tried this many times, Navani, and always failed. The songs of Honor and Odium do not mesh.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Have you tried it with a human before?” Navani asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Of course not. Humans—as we just proved—can’t hold to a tone or rhythm.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We proved nothing,” Navani said. “We had a single failed experiment.” She set her cup on the table, then crossed the room and dug through her things. She emerged with one of her arm sheaths, in which she’d embedded a clock and other devices. Like other Stormlight fabrials in the tower, <span aria-label="875" id="pg_875" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>it didn’t work any longer. But it <i class="calibre6">was</i> rigged to hold a long sequence of gemstones.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani ripped off the interior leather of the sheath, then settled at the table and fiddled with the screws and set new gemstones—full of Stormlight—into it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What is this?” Raboniel said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You can hear the songs and rhythms of Roshar,” Navani said. “Perhaps it’s merely because you have better hearing.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel hummed a skeptical rhythm, but Navani continued setting the gemstones.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We can hear them because we are the children of Roshar,” Raboniel said. “You are not.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ve lived here all my life,” Navani said. “I’m as much a child of this planet as you are.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your ancestors were from another realm.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m not speaking of my ancestors,” Navani said, strapping the sheath on so the flats of the gemstones touched her arm. “I’m speaking of myself.” She reset her experiment on the table, sending new lines of Stormlight and Voidlight out of gemstones, making them swirl at the center around an empty one.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Sing Honor’s tone and rhythm again, Ancient One,” Navani asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel sat back on her stool, but complied. Navani closed her eyes, tightening her arm sheath. It had been built as a fabrial, but she wasn’t interested in that function. All she wanted was something that would hold large gemstones and press them against her skin.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She could feel them now, cool but warming to her touch. Infused gemstones always had a tempest inside. Was there a sound to them too? A vibration …</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Could</i> she hear it in there? The tone, the rhythm? With Raboniel singing, she thought she could. She matched that tone, and felt something on her arm. The gemstones reacting—or rather the Stormlight inside reacting.</p>
<p class="fmtx">There <i class="calibre6">was</i> a beat to it. One that Raboniel’s rhythm only hinted at. Navani could sing the tone and feel the gemstones respond. It was like having a stronger singer beside her—she could adapt her voice to match. The Stormlight itself guided her—providing a control, with a beat and rhythm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani added that rhythm to her tone, tapping her foot, concentrating. She imagined a phantom song to give it structure.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes!” Raboniel said, cutting off. “Yes, that’s it!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Odium’s rhythm now,” Navani said to Honor’s tone and beat.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel did so, and it struck Navani like a wave, making her tone falter. She almost lost it, but the gemstones were her guide. Navani sang louder, trying to hold that tone.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="876" id="pg_876" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>In turn, Raboniel sang more forcefully.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No,</i> Navani thought, taking a breath then continuing to sing. <i class="calibre6">No, we can’t fight.</i> She took Raboniel’s hand, singing the tone, but softer. Raboniel quieted as well. Holding the Fused’s hand, Navani felt as if she were reaching for something. Her tone changed slightly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel responded, their two tones moving toward one another, step by step, until …</p>
<p class="fmtx">Harmony.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The rhythms snapped into alignment, a burst of chaotic notes from Raboniel—bounded by a regular, orderly pulse from Navani.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Heartbeats. Drumbeats. Signals. <i class="calibre6">Together.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani reached over and placed their clasped hands on the empty gemstone at the center of the experiment, holding them there as they sang for an extended moment in concert. In tandem, a pure harmony where neither took control.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The two of them looked at each other, then fell silent. Carefully, they removed their hands to reveal a diamond glowing a vibrant black-blue. An impossible color.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel trembled as she picked the gemstone out of its place, then held it up, humming a reverential rhythm. “They did not annihilate one another, as I assumed. Indeed, as part of me hoped. You were right, Navani. Remarkably, I have been proven wrong.” She turned the gemstone in her fingers. “I can name this rhythm: the Rhythm of War. Odium and Honor mixed together. I had not known it before today, but I recognize its name; I know this as surely as I know my own. Each rhythm carries with it an understanding of its meaning.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The sphere they had created was different from Szeth’s—blue instead of violet, and lacking the strange distortion. Navani couldn’t be certain, but it seemed to her <i class="calibre6">that</i> was what Raboniel had been seeking.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ancient One,” Navani said. “Something confuses me. Why would you have preferred that these two annihilate one another?” Navani had an inkling why. But she wanted to see what she could prompt the Fused to reveal.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel sat for a long time, humming softly to herself as she inspected the gemstone. She seemed fascinated by the motion within, the Stormlight and the Voidlight mixed to form something that surged in brilliant raging storms, then fell still—peaceful and quiet—between.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Do you know,” the Fused finally asked, “how Honor was killed?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I … am not certain I accept that he was.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Oh, he was. At least the being you call the Almighty—the being who controlled the Shard of power that was Honor—is dead. Long dead. Do you know <i class="calibre6">how</i>?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="877" id="pg_877" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“No.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Neither do I,” Raboniel said. “But I wonder.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani sat back in her seat. “Surely, <i class="calibre6">if</i> it is true—and my husband says it is, so I accept the possibility—then the mechanisms of the deaths of gods are far beyond the understanding of humans and Fused alike.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And did you not tell me earlier that <i class="calibre6">everything</i> has a mechanism? The gods give us powers. What are those powers? Gravitation, Division, Transformation … the fundamental Surges that govern all things. You said that nothing simply <i class="calibre6">is.</i> I accept that, and your wisdom. But by that same logic, the gods—the Shards—must work not by mystery, but by knowledge.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She turned the gemstone in her fingers, then met Navani’s eyes. “Honor was killed using some process we do not yet understand. I assume, from things I have been told, that some <i class="calibre6">opposite</i> was used to tear his power apart. I thought if I could discover this opposite Light, then we would have power over the gods themselves. Would that not be the power to end a war?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Storms. <i class="calibre6">That</i> was what he’d wanted. <i class="calibre6">That</i> was what Gavilar had been doing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Gemstones. Voidlight. A strange sphere that <i class="calibre6">exploded</i> when affixed to a fabrial … when mixed with another Light …</p>
<p class="fmtx">Gavilar Kholin—king, husband, occasional monster—had been searching for a way to kill a god.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Suddenly, the extent of his arrogance—and his magnificent planning—snapped together for Navani. She knew something Raboniel did not. There <i class="calibre6">was</i> an opposite to Voidlight. It wasn’t Stormlight. Nor was it this new mixed Light they’d created. But Navani <i class="calibre6">had</i> seen it. Held it. Her husband had given it to Szeth, who had given it to her.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">By the holiest name of the Almighty …</i> she thought. <i class="calibre6">It makes sense.</i> But like all great revelations, it led to a multitude of new questions. Why? How?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel stood up, completely oblivious to Navani’s epiphany. The Fused tucked away the gemstone, and Navani forced herself to focus on this moment. This discovery.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I thought for certain it was something about the nature of Odium’s power contrasting Honor’s power that led to the destruction,” Raboniel said. “I was wrong, and you have proven exceedingly helpful in leading me to this proof. Now, I must abandon this line of reasoning and focus on my actual duty—the securing of the tower.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And your promise that you would leave if I helped you find this Light?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m sorry,” Raboniel said. “Next time, try not to be so trusting.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“In the end,” Navani whispered, “you are his, and I am Honor’s.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Unfortunately,” Raboniel said. “You may remain here and continue <span aria-label="878" id="pg_878" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>whatever other research you wish. You have earned that, and my gratitude. If you would like to seek a simple job in the tower instead, I will arrange it. Consider your options, then tell me your wishes.” Raboniel hesitated. “It is rare for a Fused to be in the debt of a human.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">With that, she left. Navani, in turn, downed the rest of the cup of wine, her head abuzz with implications.</p>
