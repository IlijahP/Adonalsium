<p class="tni">A black storm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Black wind.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Black rain.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Then, piercing the blackness like a spear, a lance of light.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin Stormblessed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Reborn.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin exploded through the darkness, surrounded by a thousand joyful windspren, swirling like a vortex. “Go!” he shouted. “Find him!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Though it felt like he’d been falling for hours, he had spent most of that time in the place between moments. If he was still falling through the sky, mere seconds had passed, and his father was falling somewhere below him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Still alive.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin pointed downward, reaching out, preparing himself as hundreds of windspren met the storm and blew it back, creating an open path. A tunnel of light leading toward a single figure tumbling in the air, distant.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Still alive.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin’s Lashings piled atop one another as Syl spun around him, laughing. Storms, how he’d missed her laughter. With his hand outstretched, Kaladin watched as a windspren slammed into it and flashed, outlining his hand with a glowing transparent gauntlet.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A dozen others slammed into him, joyful, exultant. Lines of light <span aria-label="1148" id="pg_1148" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>exploded around him as the spren transformed—being pulled into this realm and choosing to Connect to him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He watched that tiny tumbling figure as it drew closer and closer. The ground, so near. They’d fallen the length of the tower and hundreds of feet below it in the storms.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The ground rose up to meet them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Almost. <i class="calibre6">Almost.</i> Kaladin stretched out his hand, and—</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Not worthy.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The words echoed against Navani’s soul, and for the moment she forgot Moash. She forgot the tower. She was someplace else.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Not good enough.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Not a scholar.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Not a creator.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">You have no fame, accomplishment, or capacity of your own. Everything that is distinctive about you came from someone else.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Lies,” she whispered. And they were.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They truly were.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She pressed her hand to the pillar. “Take me as your Bondsmith. I <i class="calibre6">am</i> worthy, Sibling. I say the Words. Life before death.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No.</i> So soft. <i class="calibre6">We are … too different.… You capture spren.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Who better to work together than two who believe differently?” she said. “Strength before weakness. We can compromise. Isn’t that the soul of building bonds? Of <i class="calibre6">uniting</i>?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Moash kicked Raboniel away and she hit the wall, limp as a doll.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We can find the answers!” Navani said, blood dribbling from her lips. “Together.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">You … just want … to live.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Don’t you?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Sibling’s voice grew too soft to hear. Moash looked down the hallway toward Navani.</p>
<p class="fmtx">So she closed her eyes and tried to hum. She tried to find Stormlight’s tone, pure and vibrant. But she faltered. Navani couldn’t hear that tone, not right now. Not with everything falling apart, not with her life seeping away.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She found herself humming a different tone instead. The one Raboniel had always given her, with its chaotic rhythm. Yes, this close to death, Navani could only hear that. His tone. Eager to claim her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Sibling whimpered.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1149" id="pg_1149" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>And Navani inverted the tone.</p>
<p class="fmtx">All it took was Intent. Odium gave her the song, but she twisted it back upon him. She hummed the song of anti-Voidlight, her hand pressed to the pillar.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Navani!</i> the Sibling said, voice growing stronger. <i class="calibre6">The darkness retreats ever so slightly. What are you doing?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“I … created this for you…” Navani said. “I tried to…”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Navani?</i> the Sibling said. <i class="calibre6">Navani, it’s not enough. The song isn’t loud enough. It seems to be hurting that man though. He has frozen in place. Navani?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Her voice faltered. Her bloody hand slipped down to her side, leaving marks on the pillar.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I can hear my mother’s tone,</i> the Sibling said. <i class="calibre6">But not</i> my <i class="calibre6">tone. I think it’s because my father is dead.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Honor…” Navani whispered. “Honor is not … dead. He lives inside the hearts … of his children.…”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Does he? Truly?</i> It seemed a plea, not a challenge.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Does he? Navani searched deep. Was what she’d been doing honorable? Creating fabrials? Imprisoning spren? Could she really say that? Odium’s tone rang in her ears, though she’d stopped humming its inverse.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Then, a pure song. Rising up from within her. Orderly, powerful. Had she done harm without realizing it? Possibly. Had she made mistakes? Certainly. But she’d been trying to help. That was <i class="calibre6">her</i> journey. A journey to discover, learn, and make the world better.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Honor’s song welled up inside her, and she sang it. The pillar began to vibrate as the Sibling sang Cultivation’s song. The pure sound of Lifelight. The sound began to shift, and Navani modulated her tone, inching it closer and closer to …</p>
<p class="fmtx">The two snapped into harmony. The boundless energy of Cultivation, always growing and changing, and the calm solidity of Honor—organized, structured. They vibrated together. Structure and nature. Knowledge and wonder. Mixing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The song of science itself.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">That is it,</i> the Sibling whispered to the Rhythm of the Tower. <i class="calibre6">My song.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Our emulsifier,” Navani whispered to the Rhythm of the Tower.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">The common ground,</i> the Sibling said. <i class="calibre6">Between humans and spren. That is … that is why I was created, so long ago.…</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">A rough hand grabbed Navani and spun her around, then pressed her against the pillar. Moash raised his Blade.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Navani,</i> the Sibling said. <i class="calibre6">I accept your Words.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Power flooded Navani. Infused her, making her pain evaporate like water on a hotplate. Together, she and the Sibling <i class="calibre6">created</i> Light. The <span aria-label="1150" id="pg_1150" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>energy surged through her so fully, she felt it bursting from her eyes and mouth as she looked up at Moash and spoke.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Journey before destination, you bastard.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Lirin hung in the air, his eyes squeezed closed, trembling. He remembered falling, and the awful tempest. Darkness.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It had all vanished. Something had yanked on his arm—slowing him carefully enough to not rip his arm off, but jarringly enough that it ached.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Stillness. In a storm. Was he dead?</p>
<p class="fmtx">He opened his eyes and searched upward to find a column of radiant light stretching hundreds of feet in the air, holding back the storm. Windspren? Thousands upon thousands of them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin dangled from the gauntleted fist of a Shardbearer in resplendent Shardplate. Armor that seemed <i class="calibre6">alive</i> as it glowed a vibrant blue at the seams, Bridge Four glyphs emblazoned across the chest.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A flying Shardbearer. Storms. It was him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin proved it by rotating so that they were right-side up—then hoisting Lirin into a tight embrace. Remarkably, as Lirin touched the Plate, he couldn’t feel it. It became completely transparent—barely visible, in fact, as a faint outline around Kaladin.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m sorry, Father,” Kaladin said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Sorry? For … for what?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I thought your way might be correct,” Kaladin said. “And that I’d been wrong. But I don’t think it’s that simple. I think we’re both correct. For us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I think perhaps I can accept that,” Lirin said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin leaned back—still holding him as they dangled barely twenty feet above the rocks. Storms. Was that how close they’d come? “Cutting it a little tight, don’t you think, son?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A surgeon must be timely and precise.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This is timely?” Lirin said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Well, you do hate it when people waste time,” Kaladin said, grinning. Then he paused, letting go of Lirin with one arm—which was somewhat disconcerting, though Lirin now seemed to be floating on his own. Kaladin touched Lirin’s forehead with fingers that felt normal, despite being faintly outlined by the gauntlet.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What is this?” Kaladin asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin remembered, with some embarrassment, what he’d finally let that one-armed fool Noril do to him. A painted <i class="calibre6">shash</i> glyph on Lirin’s forehead.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I figured,” Lirin said, “that if an entire tower was going to show faith in <span aria-label="1151" id="pg_1151" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>my son, I could maybe try to do the same. I’m sorry, son. For my part.” He reached up and brushed aside Kaladin’s hair to see the brand there.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But as he did, he found scabs flaking away, the brands falling off to the stones below like a shell outgrown, discarded. Clean, smooth skin was left behind.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin reached to his forehead in shock. He prodded at the skin, as if amazed. Then he laughed, grabbing Lirin in a tighter embrace.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Careful, son,” Lirin said. “I’m not a Radiant. We mortals break.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Radiants break too,” Kaladin whispered. “But then, fortunately, we fill the cracks with something stronger. Come on. We need to protect the people in that tower. You in your way. Me in mine.”</p>
