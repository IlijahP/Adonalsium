<figure class="fut_tit"><img alt="Shallan’s Sketchbook: Reachers. Reacher skin appears to be made of polished bronze metal, but moves as smoothly as flesh. The faint grooves that trace their surface are unique to each individual. Their pupils dilate, despite appearing to be holes poked in bronze orbs. They have no eyelashes. When they have eyebrows, they are shaped of the same bronze substance as their skin. Most Reachers maintain a form that closely matches human physiognomy, but on occasion there are unique variations. The muscularity of their form does not appear to correlate directly with their relative strength. They do not require exercise or nutrition. Their clothing choices are quite eclectic. From Azish wraps and patterns to Thaylen sailor garb, there seems to be no cohesive style to what they wear. They appear in the Physical Realm as a small ball of white fire that pulses, emitting little rings of light in bursts. When they move they leave behind a glowing trail like that of a comet." class="img1" id="fig13" src="../images/00070.jpeg" title="Shallan’s Sketchbook: Reachers.
