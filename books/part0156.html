<p class="tni">Navani managed to get to her feet, but after a few steps—fleeing toward the pillar, away from Moash—she was light-headed and woozy. Each breath was agony, and she was losing so much blood. She stumbled and pressed up against the wall—smearing blood across a mural of a comet-shaped spren—to keep from falling.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She glanced over her shoulder. Moash continued walking, an inevitable motion. Not rushed. His sword—with its elegant curve—held to the side so it left a small cut in the floor beside him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Lighteyes,” Moash said. “Lying eyes. Rulers who fail to rule. Your son was a coward at the end, Queen. He begged me for his life, crying. Appropriate that he should die as he lived.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She saved her breath, not daring to respond despite her fury, and pressed on down the hallway, trailing blood.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I killed a friend today,” Moash said, his terrible voice growing softer. “I thought surely <i class="calibre6">that</i> would hurt. Remarkably, it didn’t. I have become my best self. Free. No more pain. I bring you silence, Navani. Payment for what you’ve done. How you’ve lived. The way you—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani hazarded a glance over her shoulder as he cut off suddenly. Moash had stopped above Raboniel’s body. The Fused had latched on to his foot with one hand. He cocked his head, seeming baffled.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel <i class="calibre6">launched</i> herself at him, clawing up his body. Her legs didn’t work, but she gripped Moash with talonlike fingers, snarling, and stabbed him repeatedly with the dagger Navani had left.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1132" id="pg_1132" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The knife had no anti-Voidlight remaining—but it <i class="calibre6">was</i> draining his Stormlight. Raboniel had reversed the blade. Moash flinched at the attack, distracted, trying to maneuver his Shardblade to fight off the crazed Fused who grappled with him.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Move!</i> Navani thought to herself. Raboniel was trying to buy time.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Even with renewed vigor, Navani didn’t get far before the pain became too much. She stumbled into the room with the crystal pillar, abandoning thoughts of trying to escape into the tunnels beneath Urithiru.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Instead she forced herself forward to the pillar, then fell against it. “Sibling,” she whispered, tasting blood on her lips. “Sibling?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She expected to hear whimpering or weeping—the only response she’d received over the last few days. This time she heard a strange tone, both harmonious and discordant at once.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Rhythm of War.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Dalinar flew through the air, Lashed by Lyn the Windrunner, on his way to find the Herald Ishar.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He felt something … rumbling. A distant storm. Everything was light around him up here, the sun shining, making it difficult to believe that somewhere it was dark and tempestuous. Somewhere, someone was lost in that blackness.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Stormfather appeared beside him, moving in the air alongside Dalinar—a rare occurrence. The Stormfather never had features. Merely a vague impression of a figure the same size as Dalinar, yet extending into infinity.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Something was wrong.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What?” Dalinar said.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">The Son of Tanavast has entered the storm for the last time,</i> the Stormfather said. <i class="calibre6">I feel him.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Kaladin?” Dalinar said, eager. “He’s escaped?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No. This is something far worse.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Show me.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Kaladin fell.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The wind tossed him and whipped at him. He was just rags. Just … rags for a person.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I’ve forgotten the Words, Kaladin,</i> Syl said, weeping. <i class="calibre6">I see only darkness.</i> He <span aria-label="1133" id="pg_1133" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>felt something in his hand, her fingers somehow gripping his as they fell in the storm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He couldn’t save Teft.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He couldn’t save his father.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He couldn’t save himself.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He’d pushed too hard, used a grindstone on his soul until it had become paper thin. He’d failed anyway.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Those were the only Words that mattered. The only true Words.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m not strong enough,” he whispered to the angry winds, and closed his eyes, letting go of her hand.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Dalinar was the storm around Kaladin. And at the same time he wasn’t. The Stormfather didn’t give Dalinar as much control as he had before, likely fearing that Dalinar would want to push him again. He was right.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar watched Kaladin tumble. Lost. No Stormlight. Eyes closed. It wasn’t the bearing of a man who was fighting. Nor was it the bearing of someone who rode the winds.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was the bearing of someone who had given up.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">What do we do?</i> Dalinar asked the Stormfather.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We witness. It is our duty.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We must help.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">There is no help, Dalinar. He is too close to the tower’s interference to use his powers, and you cannot blow him free of this.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar watched, pained, the rain his tears. There had to be something. <i class="calibre6">The moment between,</i> Dalinar said. <i class="calibre6">When you infuse spheres. You can stop time.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Slow it greatly,</i> the Stormfather said, <i class="calibre6">through Investiture and Connection to the Spiritual. But just briefly.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Do it,</i> Dalinar said. <i class="calibre6">Give him more time.</i></p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Venli hummed to Agony as the slaughter began.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Not of the Radiants, not yet. Of the <i class="calibre6">civilians.</i> As soon as the Pursuer’s soldiers started toward the helpless Radiants, the watching crowd of humans went insane. Led by a few determined souls—including a gruff-looking man with one arm—the humans started fighting. A full-on rebellion.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Of unarmed people against trained soldiers in warform.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli turned away as the killing began. The humans didn’t give up <span aria-label="1134" id="pg_1134" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>though. They flooded the space between the warforms and the room with the Radiants, blocking the way with their own bodies.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Can we prevent this?” Venli asked Leshwi, who had settled beside her after being pushed aside by Stormblessed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will need the authority of Raboniel to countermand this particular order,” Leshwi said to Abashment. “The Pursuer has command of law in the tower. I have already sent another of the Heavenly Ones to ask Raboniel.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli winced at the screams. “But Raboniel said these Radiants were to be preserved!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No longer,” Leshwi said. “Something happened in the night. Raboniel had needed the Radiants for tests she intended to perform, but she had one of them brought to her, and afterward she said she needed no further tests. The rest are now a liability, possibly a danger, should they wake.” She looked toward the dying humans, then shied away as some warforms ran past with bloody axes.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It is … unfortunate,” Leshwi said. “I do not sing to Joy in this type of conflict. But we have done it before, and will do it again, in the name of reclaiming our world.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Can’t we be better?” Venli begged to Disappointment. “Isn’t there a way?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Leshwi looked at her, cocking her head. Venli had again used one of the wrong rhythms.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli searched the room, past the angerspren and fearspren. Some of the singer troops weren’t joining in the killing. She picked out Rothan and Malal, Leshwi’s soldiers. They hesitated and did not join in. Leshwi picked better people than that.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Show her,</i> Timbre pulsed. <i class="calibre6">Showhershowhershowher.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli braced herself. Then she drew in Stormlight from the spheres in her pocket, and let herself begin glowing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Leshwi hummed immediately to Destruction and grabbed Venli by the face in a powerful grip.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What?” she said. “<i class="calibre6">What have you done?</i>”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Kaladin entered the place between moments.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He’d met the Stormfather here on that first horrible night when he’d been strung up in the storm. The night when Syl had fought so hard to protect him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">This time he drifted in the darkness. No wind tossed him, and the air became impossibly calm, impossibly quiet. As if he were floating alone in the ocean.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1135" id="pg_1135" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>W<small class="calibre8">HY WON’T YOU SAY THE</small> W<small class="calibre8">ORDS</small>? the Stormfather asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ve forgotten them,” Kaladin whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Y<small class="calibre8">OU HAVE NOT.</small></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Will they mean anything if I don’t feel them, Stormfather? Can I <i class="calibre6">lie</i> to swear an Ideal?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Silence. Pure, incriminating silence.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He wants me, as he wanted Moash,” Kaladin said. “If he keeps pushing, he’ll have me. So I have to go.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">T<small class="calibre8">HAT IS A LIE,</small> the Stormfather said. I<small class="calibre8">T IS HIS ULTIMATE LIE,</small> S<small class="calibre8">ON OF</small> H<small class="calibre8">ONOR.</small> T<small class="calibre8">HE LIE THAT SAYS YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.</small> T<small class="calibre8">HE LIE THAT THERE IS NO MORE JOURNEY WORTH TAKING.</small></p>
<p class="fmtx">He was right. A tiny part of Kaladin—a part that could not lie to himself—knew it was true.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What if I’m too tired?” Kaladin whispered. “What if there’s nothing left to give? What if <i class="calibre6">that</i> is why I cannot say your Words, Stormfather? What if it’s just too much?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Y<small class="calibre8">OU WOULD CONSIGN MY DAUGHTER TO MISERY AGAIN</small>?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin winced, but it was true. Could he do that to Syl?</p>
<p class="fmtx">He gritted his teeth as he began to struggle. Began to fight through the nothingness. Through the inability to think. He fought through the pain, the agony—still raw—of losing his friend.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He screamed, trembled, then sank inward.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Too weak,” he whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">There simply wasn’t anything left for him to give.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni"><i class="calibre6">It’s not enough,</i> Dalinar said. He couldn’t see in this endless darkness, yet he could <i class="calibre6">feel</i> someone inside it. Two someones. Kaladin and his spren.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Storms. They hurt.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We need to give them more time,</i> Dalinar said.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We cannot,</i> the Stormfather said. <i class="calibre6">Respect his frailty, and don’t force me on this, Dalinar! You could break things you do not understand, the consequences of which could be catastrophic.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Have you no compassion?</i> Dalinar demanded. <i class="calibre6">Have you no heart?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I am a storm,</i> the Stormfather said. <i class="calibre6">I chose the ways of a storm.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Choose better, then!</i> Dalinar searched in the darkness, the infinity. He was full of Stormlight in a place where that didn’t matter.</p>
<p class="fmtx">In a place where all things Connected. A place beyond Shadesmar. A place beyond time. A place where …</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">What is that?</i> Dalinar asked. <i class="calibre6">That warmth.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I feel nothing.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1136" id="pg_1136" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Dalinar drew the warmth close, and understood. <i class="calibre6">This place is where you make the visions happen, isn’t it?</i> Dalinar asked. <i class="calibre6">Time sometimes moved oddly in those.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Yes,</i> the Stormfather said. <i class="calibre6">But you must have Connection for a vision. You must have a reason for it. A meaning. It cannot be just anything.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">G<small class="calibre8">OOD,</small> Dalinar said, forging a bond.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">What are you doing?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">C<small class="calibre8">ONNECTING HIM,</small> Dalinar said. U<small class="calibre8">NITING HIM.</small></p>
<p class="fmtx">The Stormfather rumbled. <i class="calibre6">With what?</i></p>
