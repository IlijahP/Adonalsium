The body appears to be made of glassy solid planes that casually fold and split into new angles as they move. They have such bony hands, and yet I am nearly certain they do not have bones. Some appear to have hands chiseled from obsidian, while others appear carved from white marble. In so many ways, Cryptics are more abstract than other spren.

I expect they would look very silly." class="img1" id="fig6" src="../images/00020.jpeg" title="Shallan’s Sketchbook: Cryptics.
