<p class="tni">Light was far more interesting than Navani had realized.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It constantly surrounded them, flooding in through windows and beaming from gemstones. A second ocean, white and pure, so omnipresent it became invisible.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani was able to order texts brought from Kholinar, ones she’d presumed lost to the conquest. She was able to get others from around the tower, and there were even a few with relevant chapters already here in the library room. All were collected at Raboniel’s order and delivered, without question, to Navani for study.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She consumed the words. Locked away as she was, she couldn’t do much else. Each day she wrote mundane instructions to her scholars—and hid ciphered messages within them that equated to nonsense. Rushu would know what she was doing from context, but the Fused? Well, let them waste their time trying to figure out a reason to the figgldygrak she wrote. Their confusion might help her slip through important messages later.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That didn’t take much time, and she spent the rest of her days studying light. Surely there could be no <i class="calibre6">harm</i> in her learning, as Raboniel wanted. And the topic was so fascinating.</p>
<p class="fmtx">What <i class="calibre6">was</i> light? Not just Stormlight, but all light. Some of the ancient <span aria-label="763" id="pg_763" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>scholars claimed you could measure it. They said it had a <i class="calibre6">weight</i> to it. Others disagreed, saying instead that it was the <i class="calibre6">force</i> by which light moved that one could measure.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Both ideas fascinated her. She’d never thought of light as a thing. It simply … was.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Excited, she performed an old experiment from her books: splitting apart light into a rainbow of colors. All you had to do was put a candle in a box, use a hole to focus the light, then direct it through a prism. Then, curious, she extrapolated and—after several attempts—was able to use <i class="calibre6">another</i> prism to recombine the component colors into a beam of pure white light.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Next, she used a diamond infused with Stormlight instead of a candle. It worked the same, splitting into components of light, but with a larger band of blue. Voidlight did the same, though the band of violet was enormous, and the other colors mere blips. That was strange, as her research indicated different colors of light should only make bands brighter or weaker, not increase their size.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The most interesting result happened when she tried the experiment on the Towerlight Raboniel had collected. It wasn’t Stormlight <i class="calibre6">or</i> Lifelight, but a combination of the two. When she tried the prism experiment with this light, <i class="calibre6">two separate</i> rainbows of colors—distinct from one another—split out of the prism.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She couldn’t recombine them. When she tried sending the colors through another prism, she ended up with one beam of white-blue light and a separate beam of white-green light, overlapping but not combined as Towerlight was.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She sat at the table, staring at the two dots of light on the white paper. That green one. Could it be Lifelight? She likely couldn’t have told the difference between it and Stormlight, without the two to compare—it was only next to one another that Stormlight looked faintly blue, and Lifelight faintly green.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She stood up and dug through the trunk of personal articles she’d had Raboniel’s people fetch for her, looking for her journals. The day of Gavilar’s death was still painful to remember, fraught with a dozen different conflicting emotions. She’d recorded her impressions of that day’s events six separate times, in differing emotional states. Sometimes she missed him. At least the man he had once been, when they’d all schemed together as youths, planning to conquer the world.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That was the face he’d continued to show most everyone else after he’d started to change. And so, for the good of the kingdom, Navani had played along. She’d created a grand charade after his death, writing about Gavilar the king, the unifier, the mighty—but just—man. The ideal monarch. She’d <span aria-label="764" id="pg_764" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>given him exactly what he’d wanted, exactly what she’d threatened to withhold. She’d given him a legacy.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani closed the journal around her finger to hold her place, then took a few deep breaths. She couldn’t afford to become distracted by that tangled mess of emotions. She reopened the journal and turned to the account she’d made of her encounter with Gavilar in her study on the day of his death.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">He had spheres on the table,</i> she had written. <i class="calibre6">Some twenty or thirty of them. He’d been showing them to his uncommon visitors—most of whom have vanished, never to be seen again.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">There was something off about those spheres. My eyes were drawn to several distinctive ones: spheres that glowed with a distinctly alien light, almost negative. Both violet and black, somehow shining, yet feeling like they should extinguish illumination instead of promote it.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani reread the passages, then inspected the pale green light she had split out of the Towerlight. Lifelight, the Light of Cultivation. Could Gavilar have had this Light too? Could she have mistaken Lifelight diamonds for emeralds? Or, would Lifelight in a gemstone appear identical to a Stormlight one at a casual glance?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Why wouldn’t you <i class="calibre6">talk</i> to me, Gavilar?” she whispered. “Why wasn’t I worth trusting.…” She braced herself, then read further in her account—right up to the point where Gavilar plunged the knife in the deepest.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">You aren’t worthy. That’s why,</i> she read. <i class="calibre6">You claim to be a scholar, but where are your discoveries? You study light, but you are its opposite. A thing that destroys light. You spend your time wallowing in the muck of the kitchens and obsessing about whether or not some lighteyes recognizes the correct lines on a map.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Storms. That was so painful.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She forced herself to linger on his words. <i class="calibre6">You are its opposite. A thing that destroys light …</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Gavilar had spoken of the same concept as Raboniel, of light and its opposite. Coincidence? Did it have to do with that sphere that bent the air?</p>
<p class="fmtx">The guard at her door began humming, then stepped to the side. Navani could guess what that meant. Indeed, Raboniel soon entered, followed by that other Fused who was so often nearby. The femalen with a similar topknot and skin pattern, but a blank stare. Raboniel seemed to like to keep her near, though Navani wasn’t certain if it was for protection or for some other reason. The second Fused was one of the more … unhinged that Navani had seen. Perhaps the more sane ones purposely kept an eye on specific insane ones, to prevent them from hurting themselves or others.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The insane Fused walked over to the wall and stared at it. Raboniel walked toward the desk, so Navani rose and bowed to her. “Ancient One. Is something wrong?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="765" id="pg_765" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Merely checking on your progress,” Raboniel said. Navani made room so Raboniel could bend down, the orange-red hair of her topknot brushing the table as she inspected Navani’s experiment: a box letting out the illumination from a Towerlight gemstone, which was split through a prism, then recombined through another into two separate streams of light.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Incredible,” Raboniel said. “This is what you do when you experiment, instead of fighting against me? Look, Stormlight <i class="calibre6">and</i> Lifelight. As I said.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, Ancient One,” Navani said. “I’ve been reading about light. The illumination that comes from the sun or candles cannot be stored in gemstones, but Stormlight can. So what <i class="calibre6">is</i> Stormlight? It is not simply illumination, as it gives <i class="calibre6">off</i> illumination.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s as if Stormlight is at times a liquid. It behaves like one when you draw it from a full gemstone into an empty one, mimicking osmosis. While captured, the illumination given off by Stormlight behaves like sunlight: it can be split by a prism, and diffuses the farther it gets from its source. But the Stormlight must be different from the illumination it radiates. Otherwise, how could we hold it in a gemstone?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Can you combine them?” Raboniel asked. “Stormlight and Voidlight, can they be mixed?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“To prove that humans and singers can be unified,” Navani said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, of course. For that reason.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">She’s lying,</i> Navani thought. She couldn’t be certain, as singers often acted in strange ways, but Navani suspected more here.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The strange insane Fused began saying something in their language. She stared up at the wall, then said it louder.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel glanced at her, hummed softly, then looked at Navani. “Have you discovered anything more?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That’s about it,” Navani said. “I couldn’t get Lifelight and Stormlight to recombine, but I don’t know if this counts as truly splitting them apart—as I’ve only split their radiation, not the pooled Light itself.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ve thought about your mixing of oil and water, and I am intrigued. We need to know. Can Stormlight and Voidlight be mixed? What would happen if they were combined?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You are quite focused on that idea, Ancient One,” Navani said, thoughtfully leaning back. “Why?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s why I came here,” Raboniel said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not to conquer? You talk of peace between us. What would that alliance be like, to you, if we could achieve it?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel hummed a rhythm and opened Navani’s box, taking out the sphere of Towerlight. “The war has stretched so long, I’ve seen this kind of tactic play out dozens of times. We have never held the tower before, true, but we’ve seized Oathgates, taken command posts, and held the capital of <span aria-label="766" id="pg_766" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Alethela a couple of times. All part of an eternal, endless slog of a war. I want to end it. I <i class="calibre6">need</i> to find the tools to <i class="calibre6">truly</i> end it, for all of our … sanity.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“End how?” Navani pressed. “If we work together like you want, what happens to my people?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel turned the Towerlight sphere over in her fingers, ignoring the question. “We’ve known about this new Light ever since the tower was created—but I am the one who theorized it was Stormlight and Lifelight combined. You have confirmed this. This <i class="calibre6">is</i> proof. Proof that what I want to do is possible.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Have you ever heard of spheres that <i class="calibre6">warp</i> the air around them?” Navani asked. “Like they were extremely hot?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel’s rhythm cut off. She turned toward Navani. “Where did you hear of such a thing?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I remembered a conversation about it,” Navani lied, “from long ago—with someone who claimed to have seen one.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“There are theories,” Raboniel said. “Matter has its opposite: negative axi that destroy positive axi when combined. This is known, and confirmed by the Shards Odium <i class="calibre6">and</i> Honor. So some have thought … is there a negative to light? An anti-light? I had discarded this idea. After all, I assumed that if there was an opposite to Stormlight, it would be Voidlight.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Except,” Navani said, “we have no reason to believe that Stormlight and Voidlight are opposites. Tell me, what would happen if this theoretical negative light were to combine with its positive?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Destruction,” Raboniel said. “Instantaneous annihilation.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani felt cold. She’d told her scholars—the ones to whom she’d entrusted Szeth’s strange sphere—to experiment with the air-warping light. To move it to different gemstones, to try using it in fabrials. Could it be that … they’d somehow mixed that sphere’s contents with ordinary Voidlight?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Continue your experiments,” Raboniel said, putting down the sphere. “Anything you need for your science shall be yours. If you can combine Voidlight and Stormlight without destroying them—therefore proving they are <i class="calibre6">not</i> opposites … well, I should like to know this. It will require me to discard years upon years of theories.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have no idea where to begin,” Navani protested. “If you let me have my team back…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Write them instructions and put them to work,” Raboniel said. “You have them still.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Fine,” Navani said, “but I have <i class="calibre6">no idea</i> what I’m doing. If I were trying to do this with liquids, I’d use an emulsifier—but what kind of emulsifier does one use on <i class="calibre6">light</i>? It defies reason.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Try anyway,” Raboniel said. “Do this, and I’ll free your tower. I’ll take <span aria-label="767" id="pg_767" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>my troops and walk away. This knowledge is worth more than any one location, no matter how strategic.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I’m sure,</i> Navani thought. She didn’t believe for a single heartbeat that Raboniel would do so—but at the same time, this knowledge would obviously give Navani an edge. Why did Raboniel want to prove, or disprove, that the two Lights were opposites? What <i class="calibre6">was</i> her game here?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">She wants a weapon, perhaps? That explosion I inadvertently caused? Is that what Raboniel is hunting?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">The Fused by the wall started talking again, louder this time. Again Raboniel hummed and glanced over.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What does she say?” Navani asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“She … asks if anyone has seen her mother. She’s trying to get the wall to talk.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Her mother?” Navani thought, cocking her head. She hadn’t thought that the Fused would have parents—but of course they did. The creatures had been born mortal, thousands of years ago. “What happened to her mother?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“She’s right here,” Raboniel said softly, gesturing to herself. “That was another hypothesis of mine that was disproven. Long ago. The thought that a mother and daughter, serving together, might help one another retain their sanity.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel walked to her daughter and turned her to steer her out the door. And while singers tended not to show emotion on their faces, Navani thought for sure she could read pain in Raboniel’s expression—a wince—as the daughter continued to ask for her mother. All the while staring unseeingly past her.</p>
