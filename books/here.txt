Kaladin struggled against the howling winds on the shattered plains, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of Parshendi. Beside him, Shallan clutched her sketchbook tightly, her red hair whipping around her face as she peered curiously at the chasms below. Further back, Dalinar, clad in his shimmering Shardplate, directed his troops with a commanding presence, his voice carrying over the din. The air was thick with anticipation and fear, a storm brewing in the distance, threatening to unleash its fury upon them all. As the first drops of rain began to fall, Kaladin's hand instinctively went to the hilt of his blade, Sylphrena fluttering around him, her form shifting in the stormlight. In this moment, the fate of Roshar seemed to hang in the balance, each character poised on the brink of a destiny greater than any of them could imagine.
