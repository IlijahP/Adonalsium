<p class="tni">Jasnah had never gone to war. Oh, she’d been <i class="calibre6">near</i> to war. She’d stayed behind in mobile warcamps. She’d walked battlefields. She’d fought and killed, and had been part of the Battle of Thaylen Field. But she’d never <i class="calibre6">gone to war.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">The other monarchs were baffled. Even the soldiers seemed confused as they parted, letting her stride forward among them in her Shardplate. Dalinar, though, had understood. <i class="calibre6">Until you stand in those lines, holding your sword and facing down the enemy force, you’ll never understand. No book could prepare you, Jasnah. So yes, I think you should go.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">A thousand quotes from noted scholars leaped to her mind. Accounts of what it was like to be in war. She’d read hundreds; some so detailed, she’d been able to smell the blood in the air. Yet they all fled like shadows before sunlight as she reached the front of the coalition armies and looked out at the enemy.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Their numbers seemed endless. A fungus on the land ahead, black and white and red, weapons glistening in the sun.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Reports said there were about forty thousand singers here. That was a number she could comprehend, could analyze. But her eyes didn’t <span aria-label="752" id="pg_752" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>see forty thousand, they saw <i class="calibre6">endless</i> ranks. Numbers on a page became meaningless. She hadn’t come to fight forty thousand. She’d come to fight a <i class="calibre6">tide.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">On paper, this place was the Drunmu Basin in Emul. It was a vast ocean of shivering grass and towering pile-vines. In meetings, the Mink had insisted that a battle here favored the coalition side. If they let the enemy retreat to cities and forts, they could hunker down and make for tough shells to crack. Instead he’d pushed them to a place where they’d feel confident standing in a full battle, as they had a slight advantage in high ground and the sun to their backs. Here they would stand, and the Mink could leverage the coalition’s greater numbers and skill to victory.</p>
<p class="fmtx">So logically she understood that this was a battle that her forces wanted. In person, she felt overwhelmed by the distance to the enemy—distance she, with the others, would have to cross under a barrage of enemy arrows and spears. It was hard not to feel small, even in her Plate.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The horns sounded, ordering the advance, and she noted two Edgedancers keeping close to her—likely at her uncle’s request. Though she’d always imagined battles beginning with a grand charge, her force moved mechanically. Shields up, in formation, at a solid march that the veteran troops maintained as arrows started falling. Running would break the lines, not to mention leave the soldiers winded when they arrived.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She winced as the first arrows struck. They fell with an arrhythmic series of <i class="calibre6">snaps,</i> metal on wood, like hail. One bounced off her shoulder and another skimmed her helm. Fortunately, the arrows were soon interrupted as Azish light cavalry executed a raid on the enemy archers. She heard the hooves, saw the Windrunners soaring overhead, guarding the horsemen from the air. The enemy kept misjudging cavalry, which hadn’t been available in significant numbers thousands of years ago.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Through it all, the Alethi troops kept marching forward, shields up. It took an excruciatingly long time, but since Jasnah’s side was the aggressor, the enemy had no impetus to meet them. They maintained their position atop their shallow incline. She could see why the enemy would think it wise to stand here, as Jasnah’s forces had to make their assault up this hillside.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The enemy resolved into a block of figures in carapace and steel armor, holding large shields and sprouting with pikes several lines deep. These singers did not fight like the Parshendi on the Shattered Plains; these were drilled troops, and the Fused had adapted quickly to modern warfare. They had a slight myopia when it came to cavalry, true, but they knew far better how to most effectively employ their Surgebinders.</p>
<p class="fmtx">By the time Jasnah’s block of troops was in position, she felt exhausted from staying at a heightened level of alert during the march. She stopped <span aria-label="753" id="pg_753" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>with the others, grass retreating in a wave before her—as if it could sense the coming fight like it sensed a storm. She had ordered her Plate to intentionally dull its light, so it looked like that of an ordinary Shardbearer. The enemy would still single her out, but not recognize her as the queen. She would be safer this way.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The horns rang out. Jasnah started up the last part of the incline at not quite a run. It was too shallow to be called a hill, and if she’d been out on a walk, she wouldn’t have remarked much on the slope. But now she felt it with each step. Her Plate urged her to move, as did the Stormlight she breathed in, but if she ran too far ahead of her block of troops she could be surrounded. The enemy would have Fused and Regals hiding among their ranks, waiting to ambush her. Other than the Heavenly Ones, few Fused chose to meet Shardbearers in direct combat.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah summoned Ivory as a Blade, the weapon falling into her waiting gauntlets. <i class="calibre6">Ready?</i> she asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Yes.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">She charged the last few feet to the pike block and swept with Ivory. Her job was to break their lines; a full Shardbearer could cause entire formations to crumble around her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">To their credit, this singer formation did not break. It buckled backward, pikes scraping her armor as she tried to get in close and attack, but it held. Her honor guard—along with those two Edgedancers—came in behind to keep her from being surrounded. Nearby, another block of five thousand soldiers hit the enemy. Grunts and crunches sounded in the air.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Holding her Blade in a two-handed grip, Jasnah swept back and forth, cutting free pike heads and trying to strike inward at the enemy. They moved with unexpected flexibility, singers dancing away, staying out of the range of her sword.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">This is less effective,</i> Ivory said to her. <i class="calibre6">Our other powers</i> are. <i class="calibre6">Use them?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No. I want to know the real feeling of war,</i> Jasnah thought. <i class="calibre6">Or as close to it as I can allow myself, in Plate with Blade.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Ever the scholar,</i> Ivory said with a long-suffering tone as Jasnah shouldered past some pikes—which were practically useless against her—and managed to ram her Blade into the chest of a singer. The singer’s eyes burned as she fell, and Jasnah ripped the sword around, causing others to curse and shy back.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It wasn’t only academics that drove her. If she was going to order soldiers into battle, she needed more than descriptions from books. She needed to <i class="calibre6">feel</i> what they felt. And yes, she could use her powers. Soulcasting had proven useful to her in fights before, but without Dalinar, she had limited Stormlight and wanted to conserve it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She <i class="calibre6">would</i> escape to Shadesmar if things went poorly. She wasn’t <span aria-label="754" id="pg_754" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>foolish. Yet this knowledge nagged at her as she swept through the formation, keeping the enemy busy. She couldn’t ever <i class="calibre6">truly</i> feel what it was like to be an unfortunate spearman on the front lines.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She could hear them shouting as the two forces crashed together. The formations seemed so deliberate, and on the grand scale they were careful things. Positioned with a kind of terrible momentum that forced the men at the front to fight. So while the block remained firm, the front lines ground against one another, screaming like steel being bent.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That was a feeling Jasnah would never experience. The weight of a block of soldiers on each side crushing you between them—with no possible escape. Still, she wanted to know what she could. She swept around, forcing more singers back—but others began prodding her with pikes and spears, shoving her to the side, threatening to trip her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She’d underestimated the effectiveness of those pikes; yes, they were useless for breaking her armor, but they <i class="calibre6">could</i> maneuver her like a chull being prodded with poles. She stumbled and felt her first true spike of fear.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Control it.</i> Instead of trying to right herself, she turned her shoulder toward the enemy, turning her off-balance stumble into a rush, crashing out of the enemy ranks near her soldiers. She hadn’t killed many of the enemy, but she didn’t need to. Their ranks rippled and bowed from her efforts, and her soldiers exploited this. On either side of her, they matched pikes and spears with the enemy—the front row of her soldiers rotating to the back line of the block every ten minutes under the careful orders of the rank commander.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Engulfed by the sounds of war, Jasnah turned toward the enemy, and her honor guard formed up behind her. Then—sweat trickling down her brow—she charged in again. This time when the enemy parted around her, they revealed a hulking creature hidden in their ranks. A Fused with carapace that grew into large axelike protrusions around his hands: one of the Magnified Ones. Fused with the Surge of Progression, which let them grow carapace with extreme precision and speed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The regular soldiers on both sides kept their distance, forming a pocket of space around the two. Jasnah resisted using her powers. With her Shards, she should be evenly matched against this creature—and her powers would quickly reveal who she was, as there were no other Surgebinders in the coalition army who had their own Plate.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">There is another reason you fight,</i> Ivory said, challenging her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Yes, there was. Instead of confronting that, Jasnah threw herself into the duel, Stormlight raging in her veins. She sheared free one of the Fused’s axe-hands, but the other slammed into her and sent her sprawling. She shook her head, resummoning her Blade and sweeping upward as the Fused rammed its hand down. She cut off the axe, but the trunk of the <span aria-label="755" id="pg_755" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>creature’s arm slammed against her chest. Carapace grew over her like the roots of a tree, pinning her to the ground.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Fused stepped away, snapping the carapace free at its elbow, leaving her immobilized. Then he turned as her honor guard distracted him.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Ah, we’re getting so much wonderful experience,</i> Ivory said to her. <i class="calibre6">Delightful.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Other soldiers came in at Jasnah and began ramming thin pikes through her faceplate. One pierced her eye, making her scream. Stormlight healed her though, and her helm sealed the slit to prevent further attacks. With Stormlight, she didn’t need it to breathe anyway. But this, like her quick summoning of her Blade, was a concession. It risked revealing what she was.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She ripped her hand free of the constricting carapace, then used Ivory as a dagger to cut her way out. She rolled free, tripping singers and kicking at their legs to send them sprawling. But as she came out of her roll, that storming Fused lunged in, slamming two axe-hands at her head, cracking the Plate. The helm howled in pain and annoyance, then lapped up her Stormlight to repair itself.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Such fun is,</i> Ivory said. <i class="calibre6">But of course, Jasnah mustn’t use her powers. She wants to play soldier.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah growled, going to one knee and punching her fist at the Fused’s knee—but it overgrew with carapace right before she connected. Her punch didn’t even move the creature. Ivory became a short sword in her hand as she slashed at the Fused—but this exposed her to another hit in the helm, which laid her flat. She groaned, putting one hand against the rock.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Steady stone,</i> a part of her mind thought. <i class="calibre6">Happy and pleased with its life on the plains.</i> No, it would resist her requests to change.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Ivory formed as a shield on her arm as the enemy began smashing. Blood on her cheek mixed with sweat; though her eye had healed, the regular soldiers were trying to get at her again, her honor guard doing their best to hold them back.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Fine.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She reached out to the air, which was stagnant and morose today. Draining Stormlight from the gemstones at her waist, she gave it a single command. <i class="calibre6">Change.</i> No begging, as she’d tried when younger. Only firmness.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The bored air accepted, and formed into oil all around them. It rained from the sky in a splash, and even appeared in the mouths of fighting soldiers. Her honor guard knew to withdraw at that sign, coughing and stumbling as they stepped back from the fight around her in a ten-yard circle. The enemy soldiers remained in place, cursing and coughing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah slammed her fists together—one affixed with steel, the other <span aria-label="756" id="pg_756" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>with flint. Sparks erupted in front of her, and the entire section of the battlefield came alight.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Magnified One stumbled in shock, and Jasnah leaped at him, forming Ivory into a needle-like Blade that she rammed directly into his chest. Her lunge was on target, and pierced the enemy’s gemheart. The Fused toppled backward, eyes burning like the fires around her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She finished off as many of the enemy soldiers as she could find in the flames. Her helm—transparent as glass from the inside—started to get covered in soot, and soon she had to retreat out of the fire.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Her vision was clear enough to see the horror of the nearby singers as they witnessed a burning Shardbearer explode from the fires, as if from the center of Damnation itself. That fear stunned them as she hit their line like a boulder, working death upon the collapsing ranks. Their corpses fell among the gleeful spren that writhed on the battlefield, exulting in the powerful emotions. Fearspren, painspren, anticipationspren.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She fought like a butcher. Hacking. Kicking. Throwing bodies into the lines to panic the others. Making waves that her soldiers exploited. At one point, something slammed into her from behind, and she assumed she’d have to face another Fused—but it was a dead Windrunner, dropped from the skies above by a passing Heavenly One.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She left the dead man on the bloody ground and returned to the battle. She didn’t think of strategy. Strategy was for stuffy tents and calm conversations over wine. She simply killed. Striking until her arms were sluggish despite both armor and Stormlight. Though her troops rotated, she didn’t give herself that luxury. How could she? They were struggling and bleeding in a foreign land, for stakes she promised them were important. If she rested, more of them died.</p>
<p class="fmtx">After what seemed like an eternity, she found herself gasping, wiping blood from her helm to see. The helm opened vents on the side, bringing in cool fresh air, and she stumbled, standing alone on the battlefield. Wondering why she’d started breathing again.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Running out of Stormlight,</i> she thought, numb. She looked down at her gauntleted palm, which was stained with orange singer blood. How had she gotten so much on her? She vaguely remembered fighting another Fused, and some Regals, and …</p>
<p class="fmtx">And her block of troops was marching up toward the center of the battle, on trumpeted orders that echoed in her head. Horn blasts that meant … that meant …</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Jasnah,</i> Ivory said. <i class="calibre6">To the side, see what is.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">One of the Edgedancers moved among the fallen, searching for those they could heal. The second stepped up to Jasnah and pressed a large topaz into her hand. He then gestured toward the rear lines.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="757" id="pg_757" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I need to do more,” Jasnah said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Continue in this state,” the Edgedancer said, “and you will do more harm than good. More soldiers will die to protect you than you will cost the enemy. Do you want that, Your Majesty?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">That cut through the numbness, and she turned to where he pointed. Reserves formed up there, among standards proclaiming battle commanders and field medic stations.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You need to rest,” the Edgedancer said. “Go.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She nodded, accepting the wisdom and stumbling away from the battlefield. Her honor guard—reduced to half its former size—followed her in an exhausted clot. Shoulders slumped. Faces ashen. How long had it been? She checked the sun.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">That can’t be,</i> she thought. Not even two hours?</p>
<p class="fmtx">The battle had moved away from this region, leaving corpses like fallen branches behind a storm. As she approached, a figure in black broke off from the reserves and hastened through the mess to meet her. What was Wit doing here?</p>
<p class="fmtx">He was trailed by a small group of servants. As they reached her, he snapped his fingers, and the servants rushed forward to towel down Jasnah’s armor. She dismissed her helm, opening her face to the air—which felt cold, despite Emul’s heat. She left the rest of her armor in place. She didn’t dare remove it, in case enemies came hunting her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Wit proffered a bowl of fruit.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What is this?” she asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Valet service.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“On the battlefield?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A place without much Wit, I agree. Or, I should say, a place that only exists when Wit has failed. Still, I should think I would be welcome. To offer a little perspective.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She sighed, but didn’t object further. Most Shardbearers had crews to help keep them fighting. She did need a drink and some more Stormlight.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She found herself staring, however. At … well, all of it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Wit remained quiet. He was expert at knowing when to do that, though admittedly he rarely employed the knowledge.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ve read about it, you know,” she eventually said. “The feeling you get out there. The focus that you need to adopt to cope with it, to keep moving. Simply doing your job. I don’t have their training, Wit. I kept getting distracted, or frightened, or confused.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He tapped her hand. The closed left gauntlet, where she held the Edgedancer’s topaz. She stared at it, then drew in the Light. That made her feel better, but not all of her fatigue was physical.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m not the unstoppable force I imagined myself to be,” she said. “They <span aria-label="758" id="pg_758" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>know how to deal with Shardbearers; I couldn’t bring down a Fused in a fair fight.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“There are no fair fights, Jasnah,” Wit said. “There’s never been such a thing. The term is a lie used to impose imaginary order on something chaotic. Two men of the same height, age, and weapon will not fight one another fairly, for one will always have the advantage in training, talent, or simple luck.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She grunted. Dalinar wouldn’t think much of that statement.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I know you feel you need to show the soldiers you can fight,” Wit said softly. “Prove to them, maybe to yourself, that you are as capable on a battlefield as Dalinar is becoming with a book. This is good, it breaks down barriers—and there will be those wrongheaded men who would not follow you otherwise.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“But take care, Jasnah. Talented or not, you cannot conjure for yourself a lifetime of experienced butchery through force of will. There is no shame in using the powers you have developed. It is not unfair—or rather, it is no more unfair when the most skilled swordsman on the battlefield falls to a stray arrow. Use what you have.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He was right. She sighed, then took a piece of fruit—gripping it delicately between two gauntleted fingers—and took a bite. The cool sweetness shocked her. It belonged to another world. It washed away the taste of ash, renewing her mouth and awakening her hunger. She’d grown that numb after just two hours of fighting? Her uncle had, on campaign, fought for hours on end—day after day.</p>
<p class="fmtx">And he bore those scars, she supposed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How goes the battle?” she asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not sure,” Wit said. “But the generals were right; the enemy is determined to stand here. They must think they can win, and so let us perpetuate this pitched battle, rather than forcing us into temperamental skirmishes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So why do you sneer?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s not a sneer,” he said. “Merely my natural charisma coming through.” He nodded to the side, to where a distant hill—small but steep-sided—flashed with light. Thunder cracked the air despite the open sky. Men tried to rush the position, and died by the dozens.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I think we’re coming to the end of traditional battlefield formations,” Wit said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They served us well today.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And perhaps will for a time yet,” Wit said. “But not forever. Once upon a time, military tactics could depend on breaking enemy positions with enough work. Enough lives. But what do you do when no rush—no number of brave charges—will claim the position you need?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t know,” she said. “But the infantry block has been a stable part <span aria-label="759" id="pg_759" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>of warfare for millennia, Wit. It has adapted with each advance in technology. I don’t see it becoming obsolete any time soon.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We will see. You think your powers are unfair because you slay dozens, and they cannot resist? What happens when a single individual can kill <i class="calibre6">tens of thousands</i> in moments—assuming the enemy will kindly bunch up in a neat little pike block. Things will change rapidly when such powers become common.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They’re hardly common.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I didn’t say they were,” he said. “Yet.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She took a drink, and finally thought to order her honor guard to rest. Their captain would send in fresh men.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Wit offered to massage her sword hand, but she shook her head. She instead ate another piece of fruit, then some ration sticks he gave her to balance the meal. She accepted a few pouches of spheres as well. But as soon as her fresh honor guard arrived, she marched out in search of a field commander who would know where to best position her.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Seven hours later, Jasnah tromped across a quiet battlefield, searching for Wit. He’d visited her several times during the fighting, but it had been hours since their last encounter.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She hiked through the remnants of the battle, feeling an odd solitude. As darkness smothered the land, she could almost pretend the scattered lumps were rockbuds, not bodies. The scents, unfortunately, did not go away with the light. And they remained a signal, defiant as any banner, of what had happened here. Blood. The stench of burning bodies.</p>
<p class="fmtx">In the end, loss and victory smelled the same.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They sounded different though. Cheers drifted on the wind. Human voices, with an edge to them. These weren’t cheers of joy, more cheers of relief.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She made for a particular beacon of light, the tent with an illuminated set of coalition flags flying at the same height, one for each kingdom. Inside, she’d be welcomed as a hero. When she arrived, however, she didn’t feel like entering. So she settled down on a stone outside within sight of the guards, who were wise enough not to run and fetch anyone. She sat for some time and stared out at the battlefield, figuring Wit would locate her eventually.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Daunting, isn’t it?” a voice asked from the darkness.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She narrowed her eyes, and searched around until she found the source: a small man sitting nearby, throwing sparks from his Herdazian sparkflicker in the night. Each burst of light illuminated the Mink’s fingers and face.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="760" id="pg_760" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Yes,” Jasnah said. “‘Daunting’ is the right word. More so than I’d anticipated.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You made a wise choice, going out there,” the Mink said. “Regardless of what the others said. It’s too easy to forget the cost. Not only to the boys who die, but to the ones who live. Every commander should be reminded periodically.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How did we do?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We broke the core of their strength,” he said. “Which is what we wanted—though it wasn’t a rout. We’ll need another battle or two on nearly this scale before I can tell you if we’ve really won or not. But today was a step forward. Do that often enough, and you’ll inevitably cross the finish line.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Casualties?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Never take casualty reports on the night of the battle, Brightness,” he said. “Give yourself a little time to enjoy the meal before you look at the bill.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“<i class="calibre6">You</i> don’t seem to be enjoying yourself.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ah, but I am,” he said. “I am staring at the open sky, and wearing no chains.” He stood up, a shadow against the darkness. “I’ll tell the others I’ve seen you, and that you are well, if you’d rather retreat to your tent. Your Wit is there, and unless I misunderstand, something has disturbed him.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She gave the Mink her thanks and stood. Wit was disturbed? The implications of that harried her as she marched through the frontline warcamp to her tent. Inside, Wit sat at her travel table, scribbling furiously. So far, she’d caught him writing in what she thought were five different alien scripts, though he didn’t often answer questions about where they had originated.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Today, he snapped his notebook closed and plastered a smile on his face.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She trusted him, mostly. And he her, mostly. Other aspects of their relationship were more complicated.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What is it, Wit?” she said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My dear, you should rest before—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“<i class="calibre6">Wit.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He sighed, then leaned back in his seat. He was immaculate, as always, with his perfectly styled hair and sharp black suit. For all his talk of frivolity, he knew exactly how to present himself. It was something they’d bonded over.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have failed you,” he said. “I thought I’d taken all necessary precautions, but I found a pen in my writing case that did not work.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So … what? Is this a trick, Wit?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“One played on me, I’m afraid,” he said. “The pen was <i class="calibre6">not</i> a pen, but a creature designed to appear like a pen. A cremling, you’d call it, cleverly grown to the shape of something innocent.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="761" id="pg_761" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She grew cold, and stepped forward, her Plate clinking. “One of the Sleepless?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He nodded.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How much do you think it heard?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m uncertain. I don’t know when it replaced my real pen, and I’m baffled how my protections—which are supposed to warn me of entities like this—were circumvented.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Then we have to assume they know everything,” Jasnah said. “All of our secrets.”</p>
