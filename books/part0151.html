<p class="tni">There was a long line at the Oathgates today, but that was nothing new. Raboniel was certain the human kingdoms knew of the occupation by now, and so had authorized the Oathgates to be opened more frequently, allowing singer troops and servants occupying the tower to rotate out.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli’s group of fifteen friends huddled behind her, holding their supplies—hopefully appearing to be merely another batch of workers given a chance to return to Kholinar for a break. Venli pulled her coat tight against the wind. Listeners didn’t get as cold as humans seemed to, but she could still feel the bite of the wind—particularly since this form had carapace only as ornamentation, not true armor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She wasn’t completely certain what to do after reaching Kholinar. Raboniel’s writ would certainly get her people out of the city, and even out of Alethkar. But Venli couldn’t wait the weeks or months it would take for them to walk to the Shattered Plains. She <i class="calibre6">had</i> to find out if her mother was still alive.</p>
<p class="fmtx">How far would the power of the writ go? Raboniel was feared, respected. Could Venli get her entire team of fifteen flown to that scout post via Heavenly One? Her mind spun with lies about a secret mission from Raboniel at the Shattered Plains. Indeed, it wasn’t too far from the truth. Raboniel had all but commanded her to go investigate the listener remnants.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1096" id="pg_1096" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">And what then?</i> Venli thought. <i class="calibre6">Raboniel knows about them. She knows I’m going. She’s manipulating me. For what end?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">It didn’t matter. Venli had to go. It was time.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre pulsed softly as she stood in the line, map case over her shoulder, trying to ignore the wind.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Are you disappointed in me?” Venli whispered to Conceit. “For leaving Rlain and the humans?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre pulsed. Yes, she was. The little spren was never afraid to be straight with Venli.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What do you expect me to do?” she whispered, turning her head away from Dul so he wouldn’t hear her talking. “Help with their insane plan? He’ll get all those Radiants killed. Besides, you think I’d be any help to them?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre pulsed. Venli was doing well. Learning. She could help.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">If I weren’t a coward,</i> Venli thought. “What if we got you a different host? A singer who cares, like Rlain.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre pulsed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What do you mean?” Venli demanded. “You can’t <i class="calibre6">want</i> me. I’m an accident. A mistake.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Another pulse.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Mistakes can’t be wonderful, Timbre. That’s what <i class="calibre6">defines</i> them as mistakes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She pulsed, more confident. How could she be <i class="calibre6">more</i> confident with each complaint? Stupid spren. And why wasn’t this line moving? The transfers should be quick; they needed to exchange people and supplies before the highstorm arrived.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli told her people to wait, then stepped out of line. She marched to the front, where a couple of singers—formerly Azish, by their clothing—were arguing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What is it?” Venli demanded to Craving.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The two took in her Regal form, then the femalen answered. “We have to wait to perform the exchange, Chosen,” she said, using an old formal singer term. “The human who works the Oathgates for us has run off.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No one else has a living Blade, which is needed to operate the fabrial now,” the other explained. “If you could find the one they call Vyre, and ask when he will return…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli glanced toward the sky. She could feel the wind picking up. “The highstorm is nearly here. We should move everyone inside.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The two argued at first, but Venli spoke more firmly. Soon they started herding the frustrated singers toward the tower. Venli walked along the plateau, Timbre pulsing excitedly. She saw this as an opportunity.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1097" id="pg_1097" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Why do you believe in me?” Venli whispered. “I’ve given you no reason. I’ve ruined everything I’ve touched. I’m a selfish, impotent, sorry excuse for a listener.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre pulsed. Venli had saved her. Venli had saved Lift.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, but I had to be coaxed into both,” Venli said. “I’m not a hero. I’m an accident.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre was firm. Some people charged toward the goal, running for all they had. Others stumbled. But it wasn’t the speed that mattered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was the direction they were going.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli lingered at the entrance to Urithiru. She hesitated, glancing over her shoulder. The previous highstorm had reached all the way past the sixth tier. This one would likely envelop nearly the entire tower, a rare occurrence, their scholars thought. She felt as if she could sense the power of it, the fury bearing down on them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What if,” she whispered to Timbre, “I offered to use this writ to smuggle Stormblessed or his family out of Urithiru?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre pulsed uncertainly. Would the writ’s authority extend that far? Venli thought perhaps it would. She wouldn’t be able to get any of the unconscious Radiants out; they were too closely watched, and someone would send to Raboniel for confirmation. But a few “random” humans? That might work.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She found Dul and the others inside the front doors. Venli gathered them around, away from prying ears, and quickly handed her writ to Mazish. “Take this,” Venli said. “If I don’t return, you should be able to use it to get away.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Without you?” Mazish said. “Venli…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ll almost certainly return,” Venli said. “But just in case, take the map too. You’ll need it to find your way to the other listeners in secret.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Where are you going?” Dul asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli hummed to the Lost. “I think we should offer to bring the surgeon and his family—including their son, the Windrunner—out with us. Help them escape the tower, take them to their own people at the Shattered Plains.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She watched them, expecting fear, perhaps condemnation. This would jeopardize their safety.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Instead, as a group, they hummed to Consideration.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Having a Windrunner on our side could be useful,” Mazish said. “He could certainly help us get to the Shattered Plains quicker.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes!” said Shumin, the new recruit—still a little too eager for Venli’s taste. “This is a <i class="calibre6">great</i> idea!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Would he help us though?” Dul asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He treated Rlain well,” Mazish said. “Even when he thought Rlain was <span aria-label="1098" id="pg_1098" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>only another parshman. I don’t like what the humans did, but if we put this one in our debt, my gut says he won’t betray us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli scanned the other faces. Singers with a variety of skin patterns, now humming a variety of rhythms. None of them hummed to Betrayal, and they gave her encouraging nods.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Very well,” Venli said, “wait for me until the storm has passed. If I’ve not returned by then, take the next Oathgate transfer to Kholinar. I’ll find you there.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">They hummed at her words, so Venli started toward the atrium, hoping she’d be quick enough to stop Rlain from trying his desperate plan. She didn’t know for certain if he’d take her offer. But this <i class="calibre6">was</i> the direction she should be moving.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Navani knelt on the floor of her office. It still smelled of smoke from the explosion the day before.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Despite Raboniel saying she wanted to scrape the chamber for broken pieces of the dagger, no one arrived to do that. They hadn’t taken her to her rooms above. They hadn’t brought her meals. They’d simply left her alone.</p>
<p class="fmtx">To contemplate her utter failure.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She felt numb. After her previous failure—when she’d exposed the node to her enemies—she’d picked herself up and moved on. This time she felt stuck. Worn. Like an old banner left too long exposed to the elements. Ripped by storms. Bleached by the sun. Now hanging in tatters, waiting to slip off the pole.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We can kill Radiant spren.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">In the end, all Raboniel’s talk of working together had been a lie. Of <i class="calibre6">course</i> it had. Navani had <i class="calibre6">known</i> it would be. She’d planned for it, and tried to hide what she knew. But had she really expected that to work? She’d repeatedly confirmed to herself that she couldn’t outthink the Fused. They were ancient, capable beyond mortal understanding, beings outside of time and … And …</p>
<p class="fmtx">And she kept staring at the place where Raboniel’s daughter had died. Where Raboniel had wept, holding the corpse of her child. Such a <i class="calibre6">human</i> moment.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani curled up on her pallet, though sleep had eluded her all night. She had spent the hours listening to the Fused in the hallway playing notes on metal plates and demanding new ones—until one final sound had echoed against the stone hallways. A chilling, <i class="calibre6">awful</i> sound that was wrong in all the right ways. Raboniel had found the tone.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1099" id="pg_1099" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The tone that could kill spren.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Should Navani feel pride? Even in that time of near madness, her research had been so meticulous and well annotated that Raboniel was able to follow it. What had taken Navani days, the Fused replicated in hours, breaking open a mystery that had stood for thousands of years. Evidence that Navani was a true scholar after all?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No,</i> she thought, staring at the ceiling. <i class="calibre6">No, don’t you dare take that distinction for yourself.</i> If she’d been a scholar, she’d have understood the implications of her work.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She was a child playing dress-up again. A farmer could stumble across a new plant in the wilderness. Did that make him a botanist?</p>
<p class="fmtx">She eventually forced herself up to do the only thing she was certain she couldn’t ruin. She found ink and paper in the wreckage of the room, then knelt and began to paint prayers. It was partially for the comfort of familiarity. But storm her, she still <i class="calibre6">believed.</i> Perhaps that was as foolish as thinking herself a scholar. Who did she think was listening? Was she only praying because she was afraid?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Yes,</i> she thought, continuing to paint. <i class="calibre6">I’m afraid. And I have to hope that someone, somewhere, is listening. That someone has a plan. That it all matters somehow.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah took <i class="calibre6">comfort</i> in the idea that there was no plan, that everything was random. She said that a chaotic universe meant the only actions of actual importance were the ones they decided were important. That gave people autonomy.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani loved her daughter, but couldn’t see it the same way. Organization and order existed in the very way the world worked. From the patterns on leaves to the system of compounds and chemical reactions. It all whispered to her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Someone had known anti-Voidlight was possible.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Someone had known Navani would create it first.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Someone had seen all this, planned for it, and put her here. She had to believe that. She had to believe, therefore, that there was a way out.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Please,</i> she prayed, painting the glyph for divine direction. <i class="calibre6">Please. I’m trying so hard to do what is right. Please guide me. What do I do?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">A voice sounded outside the room, and in her sleep-deprived state, she first mistook it for a voice speaking to her in answer. And then … then she heard what it was saying.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The best way to distract the Bondsmith is to kill his wife,” the voice said. Rough, cold. “I am therefore here to perform the act that you have so far refused to do.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani stood and walked to the door. Her femalen guard was someone <span aria-label="1100" id="pg_1100" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>new, but she didn’t forbid Navani from peering down the hall toward Raboniel’s workstation beside the Sibling’s shield.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A man in a black uniform stood before Raboniel. Neat, close-cropped black hair, a narrow hawkish face with a prominent nose and sunken cheeks. Moash. The murderer.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I continue to have use for the queen,” Raboniel said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My orders are from Odium himself,” Moash said. If a Fused’s voice was overly ornamented with rhythms and meaning, his voice was the opposite. Dead. A voice like slate.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He ordered you to come to me, Vyre,” Raboniel said. “And I requested for you to be sent. So today, I need you to deal with my problems first. There is a worm in the tower. Eating his way through walls. He is increasingly an issue.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I warned you about Stormblessed,” Moash said. “I warned all of you. And you did not listen.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You will kill him,” Raboniel said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No enemy can kill Kaladin Stormblessed,” Moash said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You promised that—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“<i class="calibre6">No enemy</i> can kill Stormblessed,” Moash said. “He is a force like the storms, and you cannot kill the storms, Fused.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel handed Moash something. A small dagger. “You speak foolishness. A man is merely a man, no matter how skilled. That dagger can destroy his spren. Spread that sand, and it will turn faintly white when an invisible spren flies overhead. Use it to locate his honorspren, then strike at it, depriving him of power.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I can’t kill him,” Moash repeated a third time, tucking the dagger away. “But I promise something better. We make this a covenant, Fused: I ruin Stormblessed, leave him unable to interfere, and you deliver me the queen. Accepted?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani felt herself grow cold. Raboniel didn’t even glance in her direction. “Accepted,” Raboniel said. “But do another thing for me. The Pursuer has been sent to destroy the final node, but I think he is delaying to encourage Stormblessed to show up and fight him for it. Break the node for me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Moash nodded and accepted what seemed to be a small diagram explaining the location of the node. He turned on his heel with military precision and marched up the hallway. If he saw her, he made no comment, passing like a cold wind.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Monster,” Navani said, angerspren at her feet. “Traitor! You would attack your own friend?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He stopped short. Staring straight ahead, he spoke. “Where were you, <span aria-label="1101" id="pg_1101" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>lighteyes, when your son condemned innocents to death?” He turned, affixing Navani with those lifeless eyes. “Where were you, <i class="calibre6">Queen,</i> when your son sent <i class="calibre6">Roshone</i> to Kaladin’s hometown? A political outcast, a known murderer, exiled to a small village. Where he couldn’t do any damage, right?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Roshone killed Kaladin’s brother. You could have stopped it. If any of you cared. You were never my queen; you are nothing to me. You are nothing to anyone. So don’t speak to me of treason or friendship. You have no <i class="calibre6">idea</i> what this day will cost me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He continued forward, bearing no visible weapon save the dagger tucked into his belt. A dagger designed to kill a spren. A dagger that Navani had, essentially, created. He reached the end of the hallway, burst alight with Stormlight—which somehow worked for him—and streaked into the air, rising through the open stairwell toward the ground floor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani slumped in the doorway, objections withering in her throat. She knew he was wrong, but she couldn’t find her voice. Something about that man unnerved her to the point of panic. He wasn’t human. He was a Voidbringer. If that word had ever applied to any, it was Moash.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What do you need?” her guard asked. “Have you been fed?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I…” Navani licked her lips. “I need a candle, please. For burning prayers.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Remarkably, she fetched it. Taking the candle, shivering, Navani cupped the flame and walked to her pallet. There, she knelt and began burning her glyphwards one at a time.</p>
<p class="fmtx">If there was a God, if the Almighty was still out there somewhere, had he created Moash? Why? Why bring such a thing into the world?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Please,</i> she thought, begging as a ward shriveled, her prayers casting smoke into the air. <i class="calibre6">Please. Tell me what to do. Show me something. Let me know you’re there.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">As the last prayer drifted toward the Tranquiline Halls, she sat back on her heels, numb, wanting to huddle down and forget about her problems. When she moved to do so, however, in the candlelight she caught sight of something glittering amid the wreckage of her desk. As if in a trance, Navani rose and walked over. The guard wasn’t looking.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani brushed aside ash to find a metal dagger with a diamond affixed to the pommel. She stared at it, confused. It had exploded, hadn’t it?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No, this is the second one. The one Raboniel used to kill her daughter. She tossed it aside, as if hating it, once the deed was done.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">A precious, priceless weapon, and the Fused had discarded it. How long had Raboniel been awake? Did she feel like Navani, exhausted, pushed to the limit? Forgetting important details?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1102" id="pg_1102" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>For there, glimmering violet-black in the gemstone, was a soft glow. Not completely used up in the previous killing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A small charge of anti-Voidlight.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Kaladin took the steps down one at a time. Unhurried as he walked toward the trap.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A certain momentum pushed him forward. As if his next actions were Soulcast into stone, already unchangeable. A mountain seemed to fill in behind him, blocking his retreat.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Forward. Only forward. One step after another.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He emerged from the stairwell onto the ground floor. Two direform Regals had been guarding the path, but they backed off—hands on swords, humming frantically. Kaladin ignored them, turning toward the atrium. He set his spear to his shoulder and strode through this central corridor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">No more hiding. He was too tired to hide. Too wrung-out for tactics and strategy. The Pursuer wanted him? Well, he would have Kaladin, presented as he had always been seen. Dressed in his uniform, striding to the fight, his head high.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Humans and singers alike scattered before him. Kaladin saw many of the humans wearing the markings Rlain had described—<i class="calibre6">shash</i> glyphs drawn on their foreheads. Storm them, they believed in him. They wore the symbol of his shame, his failure, and his imprisonment. And they made it something better.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He couldn’t help feeling that this was it. The last time he’d wear the uniform, his final act as a member of Bridge Four. One way or another, he had to move on from the life he’d been clinging to and the simple squad of soldiers who had formed the heart of that life.</p>
<p class="fmtx">All these people believed in a version of him who had already died. Highmarshal Kaladin Stormblessed. The valiant soldier, leader of the Windrunners, stalwart and unwavering. Like Kal the innocent youth, Squadleader Kaladin the soldier in Amaram’s army, and Kaladin the slave … Highmarshal Stormblessed had passed. Kaladin had become someone new, someone who could not measure up to the legend.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But with all these people believing in him—falling in behind him, whispering with hope and anticipation—perhaps he could resurrect Stormblessed for one last battle.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He didn’t worry about exposing himself. There was nowhere to run. Regals and singer soldiers gathered in bunches, tailing him and whispering harshly, but they would let a Fused deal with a Radiant.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1103" id="pg_1103" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Other Fused would know, though. Kaladin had been claimed already. He was Pursued.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As Kaladin drew near to the Breakaway—the hallway to his right would merge with the large open marketplace—he finally felt her. He stopped fast, looking that direction. The dozens of people following him hushed as he stared intently and raised his right hand in the direction of the market.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Syl,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre6">I’m here. Find me.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">A line of light, barely visible, bounced around in the distance. It turned and spun toward him, picking up speed—its path growing straighter. She grew brighter, and awareness of her blossomed in his mind. They were not whole, either one, without the other.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She recovered herself with a gasp, then landed on his hand, wearing her girlish dress.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Are you all right?” he whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No,” she said. “No, not at all. That felt … felt like it did when I nearly died. Like it did when I drifted for centuries. I feel sad, Kaladin. And cold.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I understand those feelings,” he replied. “But the enemy, Syl … they’re going to execute the Radiants. And they might have my parents.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She peered up at him. Then her shape fuzzed, and she was instantly in a uniform like his, colored Kholin blue.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin nodded, then turned and continued, shadowed by the hopes and prayers of hundreds. Shadowed by his own reputation. A man who would never cry in the night, huddled against the wall, terrified. A man he was determined to pretend to be. One last time.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He checked Navani’s flying gauntlet, which he’d attached to his belt—easy to unhook, if needed—at his right side so it pointed behind him. Kaladin and Dabbid had reset its conjoined weights the other night. It hadn’t worked so well for him in the previous fight, but now he understood its limitations. It was a device designed by engineers, not soldiers. He couldn’t wear it on his hand, where it would interfere with his ability to hold a spear. But perhaps it could offer him an edge in another capacity.</p>
<p class="fmtx">With Syl flying as a ribbon of light beside his head, he strode into the atrium—with that endless wall of glass rising as a window in front of him. An equally endless hollow shaft in the stone rose up toward the pinnacle of the tower, surrounded by balconies on most levels. Heavenly Ones hovered in the air, though he didn’t have time to search for Leshwi.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl moved out in front of him, then paused, hovering, seeming curious.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What?” he asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Highstorm coming,</i> she said in his head.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Of course there was. It was that kind of day.</p>
<p class="fmtx">People in the atrium began to scatter as they saw him, accompanied by <span aria-label="1104" id="pg_1104" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>anticipationspren. As the place emptied, he picked out a hulking figure standing in the dead center of the chamber, blocking the way to the room on the other side—the infirmary.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin brandished his spear in challenge. But the Pursuer cared nothing for honor. He was here for the kill, and he came streaking at Kaladin to claim it.</p>
