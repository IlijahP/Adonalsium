<p class="tni">Eshonai accompanied her mother into the storm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Together they struck out into the electric darkness, Eshonai carrying a large wooden shield to buffer the wind for her mother, who cradled the bright orange glowing gemstone. Powerful gusts tried to rip the shield out of Eshonai’s hand, and windspren soared past, giggling.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai and her mother passed others, notable for the similar gemstones they carried. Little bursts of light in the tempest. Like the souls of the dead said to wander the storms, searching for gemhearts to inhabit.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai attuned the Rhythm of the Terrors: sharp, each beat puncturing her mind. She wasn’t afraid for herself, but her mother had been so frail lately.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Though many of the others stood out in the open, Eshonai led her mother to the hollow she’d picked out earlier. Even here, the pelting rain felt like it was trying to burrow through her skin. Rainspren along the top of the ridge seemed to dance as they waved along with the furious tempest.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai huddled down beside her mother, unable to hear the rhythm the femalen was humming. The light of the gemstone, however, revealed a grin on Jaxlim’s face.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A grin?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Reminds me of when your father and I came out together!” Jaxlim shouted at Eshonai over the stormwinds. “We’d decided not to leave it to fate, where one of us might be taken and the other not! I still remember the strange feelings of passion when I first changed. You’re too afraid of that, Eshonai! I do want grandchildren, you realize.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="784" id="pg_784" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Do we have to talk about this now?” Eshonai asked. “Hold that stone. Adopt the new form! Think about it, <i class="calibre6">not</i> mateform.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Wouldn’t <i class="calibre6">that</i> be an embarrassment.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The lifespren aren’t interested in someone my age,” her mother said. “It simply feels nice to be out here again! I’d been beginning to think I would waste away!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Together they huddled against the rock, Eshonai using her shield as an improvised roof to block the rain. She wasn’t certain how long it would take the transformation to begin. Eshonai herself had only adopted a new form once, as a child—when her father had helped her adopt workform, since the time of changes had come to her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Children needed no form, and were vibrant without one—but if they didn’t adopt a form upon puberty in their seventh or eighth year, they would be trapped in dullform instead. That form was, essentially, an inferior version of mateform.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Today, the storm stretched long, and Eshonai’s arm began to ache from holding the shield in place. “Anything?” she asked of her mother.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not yet! I don’t know the proper mindset.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Attune a bold rhythm!” Eshonai said. That was what Venli had told them. “Confidence or Excitement!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m trying! I—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Whatever else her mother said was lost in the sound of thunder washing across them, vibrating the very stones, making Eshonai’s teeth chatter. Or perhaps that was the cold. Normally chill weather didn’t bother her—workform was well suited to it—but the icy rainwater had leaked through her oiled coat, sneaking down along her spine.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She attuned Resolve, keeping the shield in place. She <i class="calibre6">would</i> protect her mother. Jaxlim often complained that Eshonai was unreliable, prone to fancy, but that wasn’t true. Her exploration was difficult work. It was <i class="calibre6">valuable</i> work. She <i class="calibre6">wasn’t</i> unreliable or lazy.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Let her mother see this. Eshonai holding her shield in defiance of the rain—in defiance of the Rider of Storms himself. Holding her mother close, warming her. Not weak. Solid. Dependable. <i class="calibre6">Determined.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">The gemstone in her mother’s hands began to glow brighter. <i class="calibre6">Finally,</i> Eshonai thought, shifting to give her mother more space to enact the transformation, the recasting of her soul, the ultimate connection between listener and Roshar itself.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai shouldn’t have been surprised when the light burst from the gemstone and was absorbed—like water rushing to fill an empty vessel—into her <i class="calibre6">own</i> gemheart. Yet she was. Eshonai gasped, the rhythms disrupting and vanishing—all but one, an overwhelming sound she’d never heard before. A stately, steady tone. Not a rhythm. A pure note.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="785" id="pg_785" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Proud, louder than the thunder. The sound became everything to her as her previous spren—a tiny gravitationspren—was ejected from her gemheart.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The pure tone of Honor pounding in her ears, she dropped the shield—which flew away into the dark sky. She wasn’t supposed to have been taken, but in the moment she didn’t care. This transformation was wonderful. In it, a vital piece of the listeners returned to her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They needed more than they had. They needed <i class="calibre6">this.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">This … this was <i class="calibre6">right.</i> She embraced the change.</p>
<p class="fmtx">While it happened, it seemed to her that all of Roshar paused to sing Honor’s long-lost note.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Eshonai came to, lying in a puddle of rainwater cloudy with crem. A single rainspren undulated beside her, its form rippling and its eye staring straight upward toward the clouds, little feet curling and uncurling.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She sat up and surveyed her tattered clothing. Her mother had left Eshonai at some point during the storm, shouting that she needed to get under cover. Eshonai had been too absorbed by the tone and the new transformation to go with her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She held up her hand and found the fingers thick, meaty, with carapace as grand as human armor along the back of the hand and up the arm. It covered her entire body, from her feet up to her head. No hairstrands. Simply a solid piece of carapace.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The change had shredded her shirt and coat, leaving only her skirt—and that had snapped at the waist, so it barely hung on her body. She stood up, and even that simple act felt different than it had before. She was <i class="calibre6">propelled</i> to her feet by unexpected strength. She stumbled, then gasped, attuning Awe.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Eshonai!” an unfamiliar voice said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She frowned as a monstrous figure in reddish-orange carapace stepped over some rubble from the highstorm. He had tied his wrap on awkwardly, plainly having suffered a similar disrobing. She attuned Amusement, though it didn’t look silly. It seemed impossible that such a dynamic, muscular figure could <i class="calibre6">ever</i> look silly. She wished there were a rhythm more majestic than Awe. Was that what <i class="calibre6">she</i> looked like too?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Eshonai,” the malen said with his deep voice. “Can you believe this? I feel like I could leap up and touch the clouds!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She didn’t recognize the voice … but that pattern of marbled skin <i class="calibre6">was</i> familiar. And the features, though now covered by a carapace skullcap, were reminiscent of …</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="786" id="pg_786" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Thude?” she said, then gasped again. “My voice!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I know,” he said. “If you’ve ever wished to sing the low tones, Eshonai, it seems we’ve found the perfect form for it!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She searched around to see several other listeners in powerful armor standing and attuning Awe. There were a good dozen of them. Though Venli had provided around two dozen gemstones, it seemed not all of the volunteers had taken to the new form. Unsurprising. It would take them time and practice to determine the proper mindset.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Were you overwhelmed too?” Dianil said, striding over. Her voice was as deep as Eshonai’s now, but that curl of black marbling along her brow was distinctive. “I felt an overpowering need to stand in the storm basking in the tone.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“There are songs of those who first adopted workform,” Eshonai said. “I believe they mention a similar experience: an outpouring of power, an amazing tone that belonged purely to Cultivation.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The tones of Roshar,” Thude said, “welcoming us home.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The twelve of them gathered, and though she knew some better than others, there seemed to be an instant … connection between them. A comradery. They took turns jumping, seeing who could get the highest, singing to Joy, as silly as a bunch of children with a new toy. Eshonai hefted a rock and hurled it, then watched it soar an incredible distance. She even drew a gloryspren—with flowing tails and long wings.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As the others selected their own rocks to try beating her throw, she heard an incongruous sound. The drums? Yes, those <i class="calibre6">were</i> the battle drums. A raid was happening at the city.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The others gathered around her, humming to Confusion. An attack by one of the other families? <i class="calibre6">Now?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai wanted to laugh.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Are they <i class="calibre6">insane</i>?” Thude asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They don’t know what we’ve done,” Eshonai said, looking around at the flat expanse of rock outside the city where they’d engaged the highstorm. Many listeners were only now making their way out of the sheltered cracks in the ground.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Their best warriors, however, would have stayed at the city in the small, strong structures built there. More than one family had claimed a city right after a storm. It was one of the best times to attack, assuming you could muster your numbers quickly enough.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This is going to be fun,” Melu said to Excitement.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t know if that’s the correct way to think of it,” Eshonai said, though she felt the same eagerness. A desire to charge in. “Though … if we can arrive before the boasts are done…”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="787" id="pg_787" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The others began attuning Amusement or Excitement, grinning. Eshonai led the way, ignoring the calls of those leaving the stormshelter. There was a more urgent matter to attend to.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As they approached the city, she could see the rival family mustered outside the gateway, lifting spears and making challenges and taunts. They wore white, of course. It was how one knew an attack was happening, rather than a request for trade or other interaction.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As long as the boasts were continuing, the actual battle hadn’t yet begun. She’d participated in several fights for cities during her family’s years trying to claim one, and they’d always been nasty affairs—the worst one leaving over a <i class="calibre6">dozen</i> people dead on each side.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Well, today they’d see about …</p>
<p class="fmtx">She stopped, holding up her hand to make the others pause. They did so—though a part of Eshonai wondered why she had decided to take charge. It simply felt natural.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They’d been approaching a fissure in the wall surrounding the city. That wall might once have been grand, but mere hints of its former majesty remained. Most of it had worn low, split by large gaps.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Here, a figure moved in the shadows. It looked ominous, dangerous—but then Venli emerged into the light, waving them forward. How had she gotten to the city so quickly?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai approached, and Venli looked her up and down with a slow, deliberate gaze. The drums beat in the background, urging Eshonai forward. Yet that look in her sister’s eyes …</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So it worked,” Venli said. “Praise the ancient storms for that. You look good, sister. All bulked up and ready to serve.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This isn’t who I am,” Eshonai said, gesturing to the form. “But there is a certain … thrill to holding it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Go visit Sharefel,” Venli said. “He’s waiting for you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The drums…” Eshonai said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The enemy will continue howling insults for a little while yet,” Venli said. “Visit Sharefel.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Sharefel. The family’s Shardbearer. Upon obtaining this city, by tradition the defeated family had given up the city’s Shards for her family to protect and keep.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Venli,” Eshonai said. “We do <i class="calibre6">not</i> use Shards upon other listeners. Those are for hunts alone.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Oh, sister,” Venli said to Amusement, walking around her, then inspecting Thude and the others. “If we’re going to <i class="calibre6">ever</i> stand a hope of resisting the humans—when they inevitably turn against us—we must be ready to bear the weapons with which we were blessed.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="788" id="pg_788" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Eshonai wanted to attune Reprimand at the suggestion, but she remembered the things Dalinar Kholin had said to her. If the listeners weren’t unified, they <i class="calibre6">would</i> be easy pickings.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I want to get to the fight,” Melu said to Excitement, an anticipationspren—like a long streamer connected to a round sphere below—bouncing around behind her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I think it’s worth trying not to kill anyone,” Thude said to Consideration. “With this form … I feel it would be unfair.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Bear the Shards,” Venli urged. “Show them the dangers of approaching us to demand battle.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai pushed past her sister, and the others followed. Venli trailed along behind as well. Eshonai didn’t intend to use the Shards against her people, but perhaps there <i class="calibre6">was</i> a purpose to visiting Sharefel. She wound through the city, passing crem-filled puddles and vines stretching out from rockbuds to lap up the moisture.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Shardbearer’s hut was by the front wall, near the drums. It was one of the strongest structures in the city, one they always kept well-maintained. Today the door was open, welcoming. Eshonai stepped into the doorway.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ah…” a soft voice said to the Rhythm of the Lost. “So it is true. We have warriors once more.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai stepped forward, finding the elderly listener sitting in his seat, light from the doorway illuminating his pattern of mostly black skin. Feeling it appropriate, even if she didn’t quite know why, she knelt before him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have long sung the old songs,” Sharefel said, “dreaming of this day. I always thought I would be the one to find it. How? What spren?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Painspren,” Eshonai said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They flee during storms.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We captured them,” Eshonai said as a couple of others entered the chamber, striking dangerous silhouettes. “Using a human method.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ahh…” he said. “I shall try it myself then, at the next storm. But this is a new era, and deserves a new Shardbearer. Which of you will take my Shards? Which of you can bear this burden, and this glory?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The group became still. Not all families had Shardbearers; there were only eight sets among all the listeners. Those who held the proper eight cities were blessed with them, to be wielded only in hunts against greatshells. Those were rare events, where many families would band together to harvest a gemheart for growing crops, then feast upon the slain beast.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That … did not seem the future of their Shards anymore. <i class="calibre6">If the humans discover we have these,</i> Eshonai thought, <i class="calibre6">it</i> will <i class="calibre6">be war.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Give the Shards to me,” Melu said to Excitement. She stepped forward, though Thude put his hand upon her breastplate as if to restrain her. <span aria-label="789" id="pg_789" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She hummed to Betrayal, and he hummed to Irritation. A challenge from both.</p>
<p class="fmtx">This could get ugly <i class="calibre6">very</i> quickly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No!” Eshonai said. “No, none of us will take them. None of us are ready.” She looked to the elderly Shardbearer. “You keep them. With Plate, you are as firm as any warrior, Sharefel. I merely ask that you stand with us today.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The drums stopped sounding.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will not lift the Blade against other listeners,” Sharefel said to Skepticism.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You will not need to,” Eshonai said. “Our goal today will not be to win a battle, but to promise a new beginning.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">A short time later, they stepped out of the city. Once, gates had likely stood in this opening, but the listeners could not create wooden marvels on that scale. Not yet.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The battle had already started, though it hadn’t moved to close combat yet. Her family’s warriors would step forward and throw their spears, and the other family would dodge. Then the attacking family would return spears. If someone was hit, one side might withdraw and give up the battle. If not, eventually one side might rush the other.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Spren of all varieties had been drawn to the event, and spun or hovered around the perimeters. Eshonai’s family’s archers hung back, their numbers a show of strength, though they wouldn’t use their weapons here. Bows were too deadly—and too accurate—to be used in harming others.</p>
<p class="fmtx">There … <i class="calibre6">had</i> been times, unfortunately, when in the heat of fighting, traditions had been broken. Normal battles had become horrific massacres. Eshonai had never been part of one of those, but she’d seen the aftereffects during her childhood, when passing a failed assault on another city.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Today, both sides stopped as the warforms emerged—accompanied by a full Shardbearer in glistening Plate. Eshonai’s family parted, humming to Awe or Excitement.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai picked up a spear, as did several of the others. They came to a halt in the center of the field. The opposing family scrambled back, their warriors brandishing spears. Their postures—and the few sounds of humming Eshonai could make out—were terrified.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We have found warform,” Eshonai shouted to Joy. An inviting rhythm, not an angry one. “Come, join us. Enter our city, live with us. We will share our knowledge with you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="790" id="pg_790" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The others shied away further. One of them shouted, to Reprimand, “You’ll consume us! Make us slaves. We won’t be our own family any longer.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We are all <i class="calibre6">one</i> family!” Eshonai said. “You fear being made slaves? Did you see the poor slaveforms the humans had? Did you see the armor of the humans, their weapons? Did you see the fineness of their clothing, the wagons they created?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You cannot fight that. I cannot fight that. But together, <i class="calibre6">we</i> could fight that. There are tens of thousands of listeners around the Plains. When the humans return, let us show them a united <i class="calibre6">nation,</i> not a bunch of squabbling tribes.” She gestured to the other warforms, then let her gaze linger on Sharefel in his Shardplate.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We won’t fight you today,” Eshonai said, turning back to the enemy family. “<i class="calibre6">None</i> of this family will fight you today. But if any of you persist, you will <i class="calibre6">personally</i> discover the true might of this form. We are going to approach the Living-Songs family next. You may choose to be the first to join with our new nation, and be recognized for your wisdom for generations. Or you can be left until the end, to come groveling for membership, once our union is nearly complete.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She hefted her spear and threw it—shocking herself with the power behind that throw. It soared over the enemy family and disappeared far into the distance. She heard more than one of them humming to the Rhythm of the Terrors.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She nodded to the others, and they joined her, marching into the city. A few seemed annoyed. They wanted a battle to test their abilities. She’d never known listeners to be bloodthirsty, and she didn’t feel this form had changed her that much—but she did admit she felt a certain eagerness.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We should train,” she said to the others. “Work out some of our aggression.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That sounds wonderful,” Thude said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“As long as we can do it in front of everyone else,” Melu said to Irritation. “I’d like them to understand how easily I could have cracked their skulls.” She looked to Eshonai. “But … that was well done. I guess I’m glad I didn’t have to rip anyone apart.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How did you learn to give speeches?” one of the others asked from behind. “Did you learn that talking to those trees, out in the wilderness?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m not a hermit, Dolimid,” she said to Irritation. “I just like the idea of being free. Of not being locked into one location. As long as we don’t know what is out there, we’re likely to be surprised. Tell me, would we be scrambling now to get our people in order if we’d simply <i class="calibre6">explored</i> our surroundings? We could have been preparing to face the humans for generations, if we hadn’t been so afraid.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The others hummed to Consolation, understanding. Why had Eshonai <span aria-label="791" id="pg_791" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>had so much trouble persuading people before? Was her present ease because of the connection she felt with these listeners, the first warforms?</p>
<p class="fmtx">There was so much to learn from this form, so much to experiment with. She felt a spring in her step. Perhaps this would be a better form for exploration—she could leap obstacles, run faster. There was so much <i class="calibre6">possibility.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">They entered the city, her family’s warriors—those who had been throwing their spears outside—trotting in with them, immediately accepting the authority of the warforms. As they passed Sharefel’s hut, she saw Venli again, lurking in the shadows. This was <i class="calibre6">her</i> victory, after a fashion.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai probably should have gone to congratulate her, but couldn’t bring herself to do it. Venli didn’t need more songs praising her. She already had a big enough ego.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Instead, Eshonai led the group to the stormshelter, where the rest of their family was emerging. Each and every one deserved to see the new form up close.</p>
