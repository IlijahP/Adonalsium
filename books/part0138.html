<p class="tni">Venli scrambled through a nightmare of her own making.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Beneath a blackened sky, humans and listeners fought with steel and lightning. She heard screams more often than commands, and beneath it all, a new song. A song of summoning, joined by thousands of voices. The Everstorm was coming, building to a crescendo as the listeners called it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She’d imagined this day as an organized effort by the listeners—led by her. Instead there was chaos, war, and death.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She did not join in the singing. She splashed through deep puddles, seeking to escape. The Weeping rains streamed down, soft but persistent. She passed listeners she recognized, all standing in a line, their eyes glowing red as they sang.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Faridai,” she said to one of them. “We have to get away. The humans are sweeping in this direction.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He glanced at her, but continued singing. The whole line seemed completely oblivious to the rain, and mostly oblivious to her words. She attuned Panic. They were overwhelmed by the new form, consumed by it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She felt that same impulse, but was able to resist. Perhaps because of her long association with Ulim? She wasn’t certain. Venli hurried away, looking over her shoulder. She couldn’t make out much of what was happening on the battlefield. It stretched across multiple plateaus, veiled in mist and rain, shadowed by pitch-black clouds. Occasional bursts of red lightning showed that many of the new stormforms <i class="calibre6">were</i> fighting.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Hopefully they could control their powers better than Venli could. When she had released the energy of stormform—expecting grand attacks <span aria-label="1030" id="pg_1030" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>that smote her foes—the lightning had gone in wild directions, unpredictable. She didn’t think she had hurt a single human, and now she felt limp, the glorious energy expended—and slow to renew.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She hid by a large lump of rock that might have been a building long ago. Behind her, humans attacked the line of listeners she’d left; she heard screams, felt a <i class="calibre6">crack</i> as lightning was released.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Their song did not start again, but she heard humans cursing and talking in their crude tongue, voices echoing over the sound of the rain. More dead. The storm was building, yes—nearly upon them. But how many listeners would be slaughtered before it arrived?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Surely the other battlefronts are doing better,</i> she thought, squeezing her eyes closed and listening to the Rhythm of Panic. <i class="calibre6">Surely the listeners are winning.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">What of Ulim’s promises? What of Venli’s throne? She breathed in cold air, water streaming along the sides of her face, leaving her skin numb and her carapace chilled. She pressed against the rocks, trembling. It was all wrong. She wasn’t supposed to be here. She was supposed to be safe.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The sound of boots scraping stone made her open her eyes in time to see a spear coming at her. She lunged to the side, but the weapon struck across the ridges on her cheek and nose, cutting only a thin slice in her skin—mostly deflecting off the carapace mask stormform had given her face.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She fell to the ground in a puddle and tried to pull away, one hand out and pleading. The human loomed over her, a terrible figure with his features completely lost in the shadow of his helm. He raised his spear.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No, no,” Venli said to Subservience in his language. “Please, no. I’m scholar. No weapon. Please, no.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He brandished his spear, but as she cringed—turning aside her face—no blow came. The man stepped away, then jogged off, joining some of his fellows who were forming up against an approaching group with glowing red eyes.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli felt at the scrape the spear had caused, amazed at how little it had wounded her. Then she felt at her skin, her clothing. He’d … he’d just left her alone. As she’d asked. She stared after the man, attuning Derision. The fool didn’t know how important a listener he’d spared. He should have killed her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Derision seemed to fade though, as she considered. Was … was that the proper rhythm, the proper feeling, she should feel upon being saved? What had happened to her these last few years? What had she let happen to her?</p>
<p class="fmtx">For a moment she heard the Rhythm of Appreciation instead. Part of her, it seemed, didn’t want to bask in the glory of the new form. Part of her longed for the comforts of the familiar. When she’d been weak.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1031" id="pg_1031" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">And this is strength?</i> she thought as she picked herself up off the ground, listening to the thunder.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The new storm was approaching. It would save them, exterminating the humans and elevating the listeners who survived. She simply had to make certain she was one of them. She scurried away to search out a stronger group of listeners to protect her. She entered an open section of plateau, slick with water, near one of the chasms.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Bands of humans and listeners roamed along the edge of the chasm here, trying to get an upper hand against one another. If anything, the fighting in this area was more horrifying. She forcibly attuned Conceit and moved along the perimeter. Conceit. A good rhythm, a counterpart to Determination or Confidence—only grander. Conceit was a proud, strong rhythm with a surging fanfare of quick, complex, and bold beats.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That was how she needed to feel. This was her battlefield. She’d crafted this, she’d brought it all together. There was nothing to fear here. This was her victory celebration.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She passed one of the humans’ dead horses, a Ryshadium by the size. It had been killed by lightning, so at least some of her people were capable of controlling their new abilities. Ahead—illuminated by scattered light through a patch of clouds—she saw two brilliant figures fighting along the edge of the chasm. Shardbearers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli didn’t know the human, but the listener was Eshonai. She was the last of their Shardbearers. The Plate was distinctive, even if the new form had … changed her. It was hard to associate the terrible warlord Eshonai had become with the thoughtful femalen who had tried so hard to find a way out of the war.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli stopped beside a broken spire of rock and hunkered down, watching through the rain as the two clashed. Eshonai—particularly the enhanced Eshonai—could handle a duel on her own. Venli would just be in the way.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She was able to tell herself this, and believe it, right up until Eshonai was shoved off the rim of the chasm. One moment she was holding her own against the human. The next she was gone. Plunged into the abyss.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli watched her go with a feeling of disconnect. In Shardplate, Eshonai could survive that fall. Probably. Venli was the one in danger, with the human Shardbearer nearby. The new rhythms thrummed through her, whispering of power. Heightening her emotions. She was herself, not overly influenced by the form. In control. Not a slave.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Yet she felt … nothing. For a form that seemed so vibrant with emotions, that was wrong. Could the old Venli have watched her sister take a potentially deadly fall without so much as a sorrowful rhythm? Strange. Why no concern? What was happening to her?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1032" id="pg_1032" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Venli withdrew. She … she’d go find Eshonai later. Help get her out of the chasm. They could attune Amusement together as they thought of Venli—a simple scholar—doing <i class="calibre6">anything</i> to help in a fight between two Shardbearers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The battlefield decayed further as Venli sought refuge. Screams. Lightning blasts. She saw in it something more terrible than just a clash over the future of their peoples. She saw something that <i class="calibre6">enjoyed</i> the killing. A force that seemed to be growing with the new storm, a force that loved passion, anger—any emotion, but especially those that came when people struggled.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Emotion was never stronger than when someone died. This force sought it, <i class="calibre6">craved</i> it. Venli felt its presence like a building miasma, more oppressive than the rainclouds or the storm. She crept among some large rock formations. Lumps that had been buildings, now blanketed by thick crem. She wasn’t certain where she was in relation to the center of Narak.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Fortunately, she found a narrow fissure between the ancient buildings. She squeezed in, wet and overwhelmed by the building sensation. Something was coming, something incredible. Something terrible.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The new storm was here.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli allowed herself to attune the rhythm of her true emotions—the wild, frenetic beat of the Rhythm of Panic. A more virulent version of the Rhythm of the Terrors. Everything went black, the last few hints of sunlight consumed by the <i class="calibre6">weight</i> of this new storm. Then, red lightning. It electrified the sky, and Venli crouched. No. She was still too exposed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She knew with a sudden, inexplicable confidence that if the storm saw her, it <i class="calibre6">would</i> destroy her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Between bolts of lightning, she pushed out of the cavity of rock and felt her way along the side of the stone building. The winds began to howl. Something else … something else was coming. A highstorm too?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Panic almost overwhelmed her. Then—to her incredible relief—her fingers felt something. A hole cut into one of the crem-covered buildings. This was fresh, the cuts unnaturally smooth; a Shardbearer had been here.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She eagerly sought refuge inside, trying to banish the Rhythm of Panic, replace it with something else. Outside, the winds began to clash. She pressed against the rear wall of the small empty chamber, lit by the increasingly violent flashes of light outside. First red. Then white. Then the two tangled like fighting greatshells, crushing the land around them as they grappled.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Debris began to whip past the opening, lit by the rapid flashes, and the rhythms in her head went crazy. Breaking apart, movements of one melding with another. The ground trembled and groaned, and Venli sought to <span aria-label="1033" id="pg_1033" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>hide deeper in the building, away from the violence. As she passed a doorway, however, the floor undulated and she was cast to the ground.</p>
<p class="fmtx">With a sound so loud her whole body vibrated, an entire section of the stone building was ripped free—including the room she’d just left.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She was pelted by rain, exposed to the howling winds through the broken wall. This was the end. The end of the world. Tiny, terrified, she pressed herself between two solid-seeming chunks of rock and closed her eyes, unable to hear the rhythms over the sound of the tempest.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She knew what rhythm she’d hear if she could, though. For there, pressed between stones, Venli was forced to admit what she really was. The truth that had always been there, covered over, encrusted with crem. Exposed only when the winds cut her to her soul.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She was no genius forging a new path for her people. Everything she’d “discovered” had been given or hinted at by Ulim.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She was no queen deserving of rule. She cared nothing for her people. Just for her own self.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She wasn’t powerful. The winds and the storms reminded her that no matter what she did—no matter how hard she tried, no matter how much she pretended—she would always be small.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She had pretended she was those things, and would likely pretend them again as soon as she could lie to herself. As soon as she was safe. But here—with everything else flayed away and her soul stripped bare—Venli was forced to admit what she truly was. What she’d always been.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A coward.</p>
