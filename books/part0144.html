<p class="tni"><span aria-label="1060" id="pg_1060" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Adin was going to be a Windrunner someday.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He had it all figured out. Yes, he was just a potter’s son, and spent his days learning how to turn crem into plates. But the highmarshal himself had once been a darkeyed boy from an unknown village. The spren didn’t <i class="calibre6">just</i> pick kings and queens. They watched everyone, looking for warriors.</p>
<p class="fmtx">So, as he followed his father through the halls of Urithiru, Adin found opportunities to glare at the invaders. Many might have said that at thirteen, he was too young to become a Radiant. But he knew for a fact there was a girl who had been chosen when she was younger than him. He had seen her leaving food out for old Gavam, the widow who sometimes forgot to collect her rations.</p>
<p class="fmtx">You had to be brave, even when you thought nobody was watching. That was what the spren wanted. They didn’t care how old you were, if your eyes were dark, or if the bowls you made were lopsided. They wanted you to be <i class="calibre6">brave.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Glaring at singers wasn’t much. He knew he could—and would have to—do more. When the time was right. And he couldn’t let the enemy catch him being unruly. So for now, he stepped to the side of the corridor with his father and let the large group of warforms pass. He dutifully stood there, his father’s hand on his shoulder, their heads bowed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But as soon as the warforms had passed, Adin looked up. And he glared after them, angry as he could be.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He wasn’t the only one. He caught Shar, the seamstress’s daughter, glaring too. Well, her uncle was a Windrunner, so maybe she figured she had a better chance than most—but surely the spren were more discerning than that. Shar was so bossy, you’d think she was lighteyed.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1061" id="pg_1061" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">Doesn’t matter,</i> Adin reminded himself. <i class="calibre6">The spren don’t care if you’re bossy. They just want you to be brave.</i> Well, he could handle a little competition from Shar. And when he got his spren first, maybe he could give her a few tips.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adin’s father caught him glaring, unfortunately, and squeezed his shoulder. “Eyes down,” he hissed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adin obeyed reluctantly, as another group of soldiers marched past—all heading for the atrium. Had there been some kind of disturbance? Adin had better not have missed another appearance by Stormblessed. He couldn’t <i class="calibre6">believe</i> he’d spent the last fight napping.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He hoped the spren would look at people’s parents when choosing their Radiants. Because Adin’s father was extremely brave. Oh, he didn’t glare at passing soldiers, but he didn’t need to. Adin’s father spent many afternoons tending the fallen Radiants. Directly beneath the gaze of the <i class="calibre6">Fused.</i> And every night he went out in secret, doing <i class="calibre6">something.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Once the soldiers passed, everyone else continued on their way. Adin’s ankle hurt a little, but it mostly felt better from when he’d hurt it. So he didn’t even limp anymore. He didn’t want a spren to see him acting weak.</p>
<p class="fmtx">What <i class="calibre6">was</i> going on? He went up on his toes, trying to look over the crowd, but his father didn’t let him linger. Together they entered the market, then turned toward Master Liganor’s shop. It felt strange to keep following their normal routine. How could they continue making pottery at a time like this? How could Master Liganor open the shop for business like nothing was happening? Well, that was part of their bravery. Adin had figured it out.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They entered the back of the shop and set up in the workroom. Adin got busy, knowing that they had to act normal—so the enemy wouldn’t figure out something was up. You had to get them to feel secure, comfortable. Today, Adin did that by heaving out his bucket of crem, pouring off the water on top, and mixing it until it was a paste. Then he mashed it for his father until it was just the right consistency—a little more squishy than dough.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He worked the lump aggressively, showing those spren—who were undoubtedly watching him by now—that he had good strong arms. Windrunners needed strong arms, because they didn’t use their legs much, on account of them flying around everywhere.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As he worked the crem—his arms starting to burn, the earthy scent of wet rock filling the air—he heard the front door shut. Master Liganor had arrived. The old man was nice, for a lighteyes. Once upon a time, he’d done all the glaze work on the pottery himself, but now it was all completed by Gub, the other journeyman besides Adin’s father.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adin mashed the crem to the proper consistency, then handed a chunk <span aria-label="1062" id="pg_1062" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>to his father, who had been cleaning and setting the wheel. Adin’s father hefted it, pushed one finger in, then nodded approvingly. “Make another batch,” he said, putting the chunk onto his wheel. “We’ll practice your plates.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I won’t need to be able to make plates once I can fly,” Adin said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And what if it takes you until your twenties to become a Windrunner?” his father asked. “You’ll need to do something with your time until then. Might as well make plates.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Spren don’t care about plates.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They must,” his father said, spinning up the wheel by pumping his foot on the pedal. “Their Radiants have to eat, after all.” He started shaping the crem. “Never underestimate the value of a job well done, Adin. You want a spren to notice you? Take pride in every job you do. Men who make sloppy plates will be sloppy fighting Fused.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adin narrowed his eyes. How did his father know that? Was it merely another piece of wisdom drawn from his never-ending well of fatherly quips, or … was it from personal experience? Regardless, Adin dragged out another bucket of crem. They were running low. Where would they get more, now that traders weren’t coming in from the Plains?</p>
<p class="fmtx">He was halfway through mixing the new batch when Master Liganor entered, wringing his hands. Short, bald, and tubby, he looked like a vase—the kind that had been made with too short a neck to really be useful. But he was nice.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Something’s happening, Alalan,” the master said. “Something in the atrium. I don’t like it. I think I’ll close the shop today. Just in case.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adin’s father nodded calmly, still shaping his current pot. When he was on a pot, nothing could shake him. He kept sculpting, wetting his fingers absently.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What do you think?” Master Liganor asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A good idea,” Adin’s father replied. “Put out the glyph for lunch, and maybe we can reopen later.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Good, good,” the master said, bustling out of the workshop into the attached showroom. “I think … I think I’ll head to my room for a while. You’ll keep working? We’re low on water pots. As always.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Master Liganor closed and latched the wooden windows at the front of the small shop, then locked the door. Then he went upstairs to his rooms.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As soon as he was gone, Adin’s father stood up, leaving a pot <i class="calibre6">half-finished</i> on the wheel. “Watch the shop, son,” he said, washing his hands, then walked toward the back door.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Short, with curly hair and a quiet way about him, he was not the type someone would pick out of a crowd as a hero. Yet Adin knew exactly where <span aria-label="1063" id="pg_1063" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>he was going. Adin stood up, hands coated in crem. “You’re going to go see what’s happening, aren’t you? In the atrium?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">His father hesitated, his hand on the doorknob. “Stay here and watch the shop.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re going to paint your head with the glyph,” Adin said, “and go watch over the Radiants. Just in case. I want to go with you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your ankle—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Is fine now,” Adin said. “If something <i class="calibre6">does</i> go wrong, you’ll need me to run home and tell Mother. Plus, if there’s trouble, there could be looting here in the market. I’ll be safer with you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adin’s father debated, then sighed and waved him forward. Adin felt his heart thundering in his chest as he hurried to obey. He could feel it, an energy in the air. It would happen <i class="calibre6">today.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Today, he’d pick up a spear and earn his spren.</p>
