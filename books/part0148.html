<p class="tni">Jasnah leaned back in her chair, lit by spherelight. The spanreed report had just arrived; today’s conflict with the enemy armies had ended. The coalition forces had won. Emul was, essentially, now theirs.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She still ached from her part in earlier battles, though she’d sat this one out—Dalinar had been there, and they didn’t want to put both of them on the same battlefield at once. Regardless, this particular offensive being finished checked one thing off her list, but there was so much to do, still, with Urithiru in enemy hands.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Her house here in their command camp was far nicer than the one Dalinar had picked for himself. She’d chosen it not for the luxury, or for the space, but because it had a second floor. Locked away in a central room on the second level—sharing no walls with the outside, alone save for Wit’s company—she could finally let herself relax. If a Shardbearer broke in, or if a Skybreaker came through one of the upper windows, her fabrial traps would go off—sounding the alarm and giving her time to fight or escape into Shadesmar before she could be killed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She had a boat waiting on the other side, as close to analogous to this location as Shadesmar would allow. She kept stores of Stormlight in the pockets of her dressing gown, which she now wore. She would never again be caught unaware. She would never again be left struggling in Shadesmar <span aria-label="1077" id="pg_1077" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>without proper resources, forced to spend weeks hunting a perpendicularity. It was only with these preparations that Jasnah felt safe enough to let herself become frustrated.</p>
<p class="fmtx">In her lifetime studying history, Jasnah had been guided by two principles. First, that she must cut through the biases of the historians in order to understand the past. Second, that only in understanding the past could she properly prepare for the future. She’d dedicated so much to this study. But a life’s work could be shaken when history got up and started talking to you.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She leafed through papers more valuable than the purest emerald, filled with her interviews with the Heralds Ash and Taln. Living history. People who had <i class="calibre6">seen</i> the events she’d read about. In essence, years of her life had been wasted. What good were her theories now? They were halfway-reliable re-creations of what <i class="calibre6">might</i> have happened, pieced together from fragments of different manuscripts.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Well, now she could simply ask. The Challenge of Stormhold? Oh, Ash had been there. King Iyalid had been drunk. The treaty of four nights? A delaying tactic intended to position the enemy for a betrayal. All those debates, and Jochi was right while Jasnah was wrong. Settled as easily as that.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Of course, there were things the Heralds didn’t know, things they wouldn’t say, or—in Taln’s case—things they <i class="calibre6">couldn’t</i> say. Jasnah flipped through the pages, trying to piece together anything from her more recent interviews that would help with the situation at Urithiru. Even the Heralds knew little of this Sibling, the secretive tower spren.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She needed to present this to the other Veristitalians, see what they could tease from it all. Yet the words of the Heralds cast doubt on her second guiding principle—that the past was the best gauge of the future. There was another way. The enemy could see what would happen in the future. That terrified her. In relying on the past, Jasnah saw the future through occluded glass from within a chasm, if at all. Odium had a prime spot atop the watchtower.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She sighed, and Wit unfolded himself from the chair snug in the corner on the other side of the room. He stretched, then wandered over and knelt beside her before taking her unclothed safehand and kissing the tip of the index finger.</p>
<p class="fmtx">At that, Jasnah felt a little thrill of mystery. She’d come to realize, early in her youth, that she didn’t approach relationships the same way everyone else seemed to. Her partners in the past had always complained that she was too cold, so academic. That had frustrated her. How was she to learn what others felt if she couldn’t ask them?</p>
<p class="fmtx">She didn’t have that problem with Wit. He presented an entire world <span aria-label="1078" id="pg_1078" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>of other problems, but he never was bothered by her questions. Even if he often dodged them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My dear,” he said, “you pay me no heed. Be careful not to give undue attention only to the ravings of the mad. I warn you, without proper affection, your Wit will wilt.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She removed her hand from his grip and studied him. Keen eyes. A nose that was perhaps a bit too sharp. Most women, she suspected, would find him physically attractive. And indeed she appreciated his statuesque quality, with such interesting proportions and such an intense face. The nose humanized him, in her opinion, made him feel more real.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Curiously, he wasn’t Alethi, but he had transformed himself to look like one. She’d been able to tease that much from him. He was something more ancient. He’d laughed when she’d asked, and said the Alethi hadn’t <i class="calibre6">existed</i> when he’d been born, so he couldn’t have been credited the honor of being one of her gifted people.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She found the way he spoke fascinating. After all this time—and all her worries—here was one who was her intellectual equal. Perhaps her <i class="calibre6">superior.</i> She didn’t trust him, of course. But that was part of what intrigued her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How do we beat him, Wit?” she asked softly. “If he can truly see the future, then what possible chance do we have?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I once knew a man,” Wit said, “who was the finest gambler in all his realm. Where he lived, you make your cards walk themselves around the table by breathing life into them. He was the best. Intelligent, skilled with the Breath of life, a shrewd gambler—he knew exactly how to bet and when. Everyone was <i class="calibre6">waiting</i> for the day when he lost. And eventually he did.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That’s different, Wit,” Jasnah said. “He couldn’t literally see the future.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ah, but you see, I was <i class="calibre6">rigging</i> the games. So I did know the future—as much as Odium does, anyway. I <i class="calibre6">shouldn’t</i> have been able to lose. Yet I did.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Someone <i class="calibre6">else</i> rigged the game so that no matter what move I made, I could not win. The game was a tie, something I hadn’t anticipated. I’d focused my cheating on making certain I didn’t lose, but I’d bet on myself winning. And I bet it all, you see—if I’d have been more clever, I’d have let less be lost.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So,” she said, “how do we set it up so Odium doesn’t win, even if he can’t lose?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Wit unfolded a paper from his pocket, still kneeling beside her. He seemed to genuinely like her, and she found his companionship invigorating. Full of questions, delights, and surprises. She could provide the intimacy he desired, though she knew he found her lack of excitement on that axis odd, perhaps unsatisfying. That was not a new experience for her; <span aria-label="1079" id="pg_1079" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>she’d always found it curious how others put their physical urges ahead of the more powerful emotions of bonding, relating, and engaging.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The chance to scheme, to <i class="calibre6">connect</i> with a being like Wit—<i class="calibre6">that</i> was exciting. She was curious how the relationship would develop, and that invigorated her. After so many failures, this was something new and interesting.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She cupped his face with her hand. She wished she could, deep down, truly trust him. He was something she, and this world, had never before known. That was electrifying. It was also so <i class="calibre6">extremely</i> dangerous.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Wit smiled at her, then smoothed out the paper on her writing desk. It was scribed in his own hand, of course. He came from a land where men had been encouraged to write, the same as women. He shot her a glance, then his smile became a grin. Yes, he <i class="calibre6">did</i> seem genuinely fond of their relationship, as much as she was. Indeed, he said it had taken him by surprise as it had her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A contract,” she said, turning from him and reading the paper. “For Dalinar’s contest with Odium.” Wit had undoubtedly sculpted each word with precision. “If Dalinar wins, Odium retreats to Damnation for a thousand years. If Odium wins, he must remain in the system, but gets Roshar to do with as he pleases. The monarchs will submit to his rule—as will the Radiants who follow Dalinar.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Perfect,” Wit said. “Wouldn’t you say?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah sat back. “Perfect for you. If this is agreed to, you win no matter what. Odium remains contained in the Rosharan system either way.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Wit spread his hands before himself. “I’ve learned a few things since that challenge with the cards so many years ago. But Jasnah, this <i class="calibre6">is</i> for the best. If Dalinar wins, well, your people get what they want. But if Dalinar loses, Odium is contained. We’re limiting our losses—making certain that at the boundaries of this planet, hell and hate must halt.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It puts everything on this one contest of champions,” Jasnah said. “I hate that tradition even when played for lower stakes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Says the woman who used me in a ploy to manipulate that very tradition not two weeks ago.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Lower stakes,” Jasnah repeated, “involving a meaningless loss such as your death.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Jasnah!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Wit, you’re immortal,” she said. “You told me yourself.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And you believed me?” he asked, aghast.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She paused and studied him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He grinned, then kissed her hand again. He seemed to think that sort of thing would eventually spark passion in her. When in truth, physical stimulation was so inferior to mental stimulation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I told you I haven’t died when killed—yet,” he said. “Doesn’t mean <span aria-label="1080" id="pg_1080" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>someone won’t find a way someday, and I’d rather not give them an opportunity. Besides, even for me, being killed can confound.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Don’t distract me,” she said. “Can we really risk the fate of the world on a simple <i class="calibre6">duel</i>?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ah, but it’s not a duel, Jasnah. That’s the thing. It’s not about the <i class="calibre6">contest,</i> but what <i class="calibre6">leads up</i> to the contest. I know Rayse. He is arrogant and enjoys being worshipped. He never does anything without delighting in how he can show off.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He’s also careful. Subtle. So to win, we need to make him certain he can’t utterly lose. This contract does that. If his fail state is that he has to wait a thousand years to try again, well, that won’t bother him. He has been here for thousands of years already. So he’ll see another thousand as an acceptable loss. But to you and the budding Radiants, a thousand years is a <i class="calibre6">long</i> time. Long as a soulless star slumbers.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A soulless star.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Slumbers.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“As they do.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She stared at him flatly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Long as a rat rends rust?” he asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Long as seasons see stories?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Oh, that’s <i class="calibre6">delightful,</i> Jasnah. Pretend I was the one who could somehow stress said symphonion sounds.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She cocked an eyebrow at him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It means beautiful,” he said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No it doesn’t.” She again studied the contract. “Sometimes I feel you aren’t taking this as <i class="calibre6">seriously</i> as you should, Wit.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s a personal failing,” he said. “The more serious something becomes, the more I find myself inappropriately involved. Indeedy.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah sighed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ll stop,” he said with a grin. “I promise. But look, Jasnah, Rayse—Odium—<i class="calibre6">is</i> someone we can defeat. If he has one great failing it’s that he thinks he’s smarter than he is. He tried exceptionally hard to make Dalinar into his champion. Why? Because he doesn’t merely want to win, he wants to win in a way that <i class="calibre6">says</i> something. To everyone watching.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He was so certain he could turn the Blackthorn that he bet almost everything on that singular gamble. Now he must be scared. While he pretends he has a dozen other plans, he’s scrambling to locate a champion who can legitimately win. Because he knows—same as I’m telling you—that the contest <i class="calibre6">won’t</i> only be about who can stab the hardest with their spear.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What will it be about then?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1081" id="pg_1081" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Same thing it’s always about, Jasnah,” Wit said. “The hearts of men and women. Do you trust the hearts of those who fight on your side?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She paused, and hoped he didn’t read too much into it. Staring at the contract, she couldn’t help but feel outmatched by all of this. She, who had been preparing for nearly two <i class="calibre6">decades</i> for these exact events, felt uncertain. Did she trust her <i class="calibre6">own</i> heart, when confronted with ancient troubles that had surely defeated better women than her?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A wise answer,” Wit whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I didn’t give one.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A wise answer.” He squeezed her hand. “If you give Odium this contract—and get me the <i class="calibre6">assurance</i> that he <i class="calibre6">cannot</i> break free of this planetary system no matter what happens—then you won’t have to trust the hearts of mortals, Jasnah. Because you’ll have me. And everything I can give you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’ve told me he would destroy you if he found you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’ll add a line to the contract,” Wit said, “naming me as a contractual liaison for Honor—whom Dalinar represents. This will protect me from Odium’s direct attacks for the life of the contract. He will <i class="calibre6">have</i> to abide by those terms, as they are part of the promise Rayse made by taking up the Shard of Odium. To fail that promise would give others an opening against him, and said failures have killed gods before. Odium knows it. So do this, and I can help you openly. As myself.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And who is that, Wit?” she asked. “Who are you <i class="calibre6">really</i>?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Someone,” he said, “who wisely turned down the power the others all took—and in so doing, gained freedoms they can never again have. I, Jasnah, am someone who <i class="calibre6">is not bound.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She met his eyes—the eyes of something that wasn’t a man. A thing that was eternal as a spren. Or, if he was to be believed, something even <i class="calibre6">older.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“I feel,” she said, “like I should be terrified by that statement.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That’s why I’m so fond of you,” he said. “You are poised, you are smart, and you are always ready with a ploy; but when each of those things fails you, Jasnah, you are—above all else—<i class="calibre6">paranoid.</i>”</p>
