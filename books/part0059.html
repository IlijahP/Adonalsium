<p class="lti"><span aria-label="456" id="pg_456" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">I find this difficult to do on an intrinsic level, as although I am neither Ruin nor Preservation,</span> <span class="esans_caslonantique_medium_">they</span> <span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">make up</span> <span class="esans_caslonantique_medium_">me.</span></p>
<p class="tni">“I cannot fathom this,” Notum said, staring ahead. He didn’t blink. “I just cannot <i class="calibre6">fathom</i> this.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant had noticed that quirk in numerous spren in this world; they forgot to blink when they were distracted or overwhelmed. She shooed away the shockspren who were clustering around the spren, practically trying to climb in his lap. It was so strange for all the spren here to have physical forms; they sometimes had to be pushed away with a weapon.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin’s soldiers stood in a cluster on a nearby rise, spyglasses to their eyes, keeping a cautious watch on the enemy caravan. It was—fortunately—withdrawing. Shallan’s agents were circumspectly going through the pockets of the dead, searching for clues to their origins. She spotted Vathah depositing some spheres into his own pouch, and was going to shout at him, but Veil persuaded her to hold her tongue. What else were they going to do? Leave the money?</p>
<p class="fmtx">The spheres, as expected, were dun. There was no Stormlight here. Though Godeke had inspected Adolin’s side wound and given a good prognosis, she would rather see him healed. Sepsis could claim any wound, but especially gut wounds.</p>
<p class="fmtx">In addition, Radiant suspected Notum could use a little Stormlight. Though his wounds had stopped “bleeding,” his glow had dampened noticeably, and his cheery blue-white coloring had become a dull brown-white.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He spoke in a daze. “Why … why would they do this? Humans have <span aria-label="457" id="pg_457" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>never … attacked spren. What would be the point, the use, the purpose? There is no honor in this!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">His Reacher companions had been released from their bonds as well. In Radiant’s experience, the bronze-colored spren tended to be quiet. These three—one male, two female, wearing simple uniforms—gave no response. They seemed as baffled as Notum.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We need to take you to Lasting Integrity,” Adolin said, sitting on a rock nearby as Godeke bound his wound.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No,” Notum said. “No, I am exiled.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re wounded, and we can’t guarantee those humans won’t return the moment we leave you,” Adolin said. “Exile or not, you’re coming with us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Notum glanced from Adolin to Radiant, then looked down. “Your honor does you credit, Prince Adolin, but you must realize my presence in your party will do you harm. I was exiled precisely because I showed you leniency in the past. If I arrive with you now, whatever the reason, it will be seen as conspiracy between us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’ll deal with that then,” Adolin said, wincing as Godeke pulled his bandage tight. “Kelek knows, it’s probably not going to matter—since they’re likely to turn us away regardless.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I wish that were not true, but it is,” Notum said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant joined her agents. Ishnah was speaking softly to Beryl, who sat on the ground nearby, picking through some of the loot. Beryl had thrown up several times upon first encountering the corpses, and she still seemed pallid from the sight, though her tan skin tone made that difficult to read.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Make sure you check the insides of rings, the backs of necklaces,” Ishnah was saying. “Sometimes there are inscriptions with names.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Beryl nodded. She kept glancing at the bloodied cloth they’d put over a dead Tukari man’s neck stump. She put her hand to her lips, pointedly turning away.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">All right,</i> Shallan admitted, <i class="calibre6">if she’s the Ghostblood, she’s an</i> incredible <i class="calibre6">actor. I agree with Veil. We need to rethink our conclusion there.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin stood up. “Let’s get moving,” he said to the others. “I want more space between us and the rest of those Tukari.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">It took a little time to get Notum up on one of the horses, during which Godeke—oddly—began moving among the fallen, inspecting their faces.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Godeke?” Shallan asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They’re going to be left out here to rot,” Godeke said quietly. “Those others won’t come back for them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They tried to kill Notum,” Adolin said. “And me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I realize this,” Godeke said. “But we don’t know their story. These could be soldiers following orders. They could be confused, mistaking the <span aria-label="458" id="pg_458" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>honorspren for enemies. They could have motives we can’t even guess. I want to remember them. In case no one else does.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Edgedancers. Shallan shook her head, then checked on Adolin herself. She poked at his bloodied side. “That’s another uniform you’ve ruined.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Cold water and a soak in salt can get the blood out,” he said. “And I brought my sewing kit. Bet I can have it presentable with a little work.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Still,” she said, resting her head against his chest—careful not to touch the wound. “You need to be careful. We don’t have any Stormlight left to heal ourselves.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So … basically it’s how it’s been for most of my life?” Adolin said. He rested his hand on her back. “Maybe I did get carried away, Shallan. But it was good to find something I could <i class="calibre6">do.</i> Successfully, I mean. These days it’s not common that I find a place where I’m useful.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Adolin…” She pulled away and studied his face. He was smiling, but his tone wasn’t joking.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Sorry,” he said. “That sounded a lot like self-pity, didn’t it? I’m just tired. Come on, we really should get going.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">That wasn’t the end of the discussion—she’d press him on it later—but for now it was probably best to do as he said. They left the corpses and trudged across the open field of obsidian toward their camp. About halfway back, they met the Cryptics—save Pattern—and the Stump with her spren, hiking slowly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Arshqqam took in the sight, then nodded in satisfaction and turned to start hiking back. Fortunately, Notum <i class="calibre6">did</i> seem to be looking better already.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your deadeye,” he said, moving up beside Adolin. “How did you train her to fight for you like that?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan glanced at Maya, who was riding on Adolin’s Ryshadium. Shallan hadn’t seen it, but she’d heard. The dead spren had picked up a sword and fought beside Adolin.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I didn’t train her, Notum,” Adolin said. “She chose to help me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Deadeyes can’t make choices,” Notum said. “They don’t have the presence of mind for it. I know this personally. My own father is a deadeye, cared for in the fortress now.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Revise what you know, Notum,” Adolin said. “Maybe something changed once Radiants started returning. Or maybe some deadeyes are more responsive than others.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It simply … it doesn’t make sense…” Notum said, but abandoned the argument.</p>
<p class="fmtx">At their camp, a perky Pattern was happily waving to them. Shallan smiled at that. No matter what else happened, she could count on Pattern to be his same awkward—yet encouraging—self.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="459" id="pg_459" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Adolin didn’t give them time to rest. He ordered the horses watered, but supplies packed up so they could march straight for Lasting Integrity. Radiant took over from Shallan again as he gave the commands, and she immediately recognized the wisdom in them. Despite Adolin’s brilliant show of swordplay, their group was quite exposed. Without Stormlight, most of the Radiants barely counted as warriors. Adolin was wounded, and Notum struggled to remain upright. If the Tukari regrouped and decided to charge them … Well, best to remove the option and push—difficult as it would be—to reach the honorspren stronghold before the day was done.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil checked with Vathah and Ishnah about the corpses they’d searched. The pilfering had been quick, and their findings slim. A few cloth bracelets had patterns Ishnah said she thought were Tukari clan writing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">After that Radiant checked with Pattern, but nothing unusual had happened while they were gone. Finally, as their supplies were being loaded onto the packhorses, Shallan took over and moved to check on Mraize’s communication cube out of habit. Shallan unlocked the trunk and popped it open, then gave a quick glance inside. She didn’t expect …</p>
<p class="fmtx">The powder had been disturbed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Suppressing her immediate shock, Shallan took a Memory, then shut the trunk and clicked the lock closed. She moved by rote, letting one of the soldiers load it on a horse. Then she stood there, stunned. The powder had been brushed faintly by fingers; she could visualize it <i class="calibre6">distinctly.</i> It had been returned in the right orientation, but Veil’s trick with the powder revealed the truth.</p>
<p class="fmtx">How … She’d checked it earlier. Just before they’d all run off after Adolin. But then she’d left the camp under the watch of …</p>
<p class="fmtx">Of Pattern.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Mmmm…” he said, making Shallan jump as she noticed him standing right behind her. “An eventful day with humans! Your lives are always so exciting. Mmm…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Pattern,” Veil said, “nothing happened here while we were gone. You are sure?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, very sure. Ha ha. You had excitement, and I was bored. It is irony! Ha ha.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Veil, this can’t … this can’t be possible,</i> Shallan thought. <i class="calibre6">We can’t be suspicious of</i> Pattern <i class="calibre6">of all people. It … I can’t …</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Yet hadn’t <i class="calibre6">he</i> been standing nearby when she’d mentioned the secret to Beryl that had made its way to Mraize? And she’d told him about the orientation issue with the cube, so it was no wonder that this time—in using it—the spy had returned it exactly the right way.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant wasn’t convinced. And … it was ridiculous, wasn’t it? To think Pattern could be spying on her for the Ghostbloods? He loved lies, but she doubted he could manage one himself. At least not one that would fool Veil.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="460" id="pg_460" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Shallan took over, and tried to put the idea out of her mind as they began walking. But it wouldn’t leave her alone. Veil and even Radiant began to wonder. He’d had opportunity. He knew about the communication cube, and had been watching over it the night she’d been drunk.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan’s father had belonged to the Ghostbloods; her family had been involved with them all the way back in her youth. Perhaps in her childhood, during those shadowy days she’d forgotten? Could the conspiracy go back that far?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Her association with Pattern stretched back to that time, for certain. She’d used him as a Blade to kill her mother. Shallan had suppressed many of those memories, but this fact was indisputable. Pattern and she had begun to bond nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Could Pattern have been working with them all along? Feeding them information about her progress? Leading her to contact them when she’d first come to the warcamps?</p>
<p class="fmtx">The implications of that shook her to the core. If her spren was a spy … could she trust anything?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Could she even keep going? This revelation was far, far worse than discovering Vathah or Ishnah had been the spy. This … this made her tremble. Made her legs weak.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Shallan,</i> Radiant thought. <i class="calibre6">Be strong. We don’t know all the facts yet.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">No. No, she couldn’t be strong. Not in the face of this.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She crawled away, deep within, and started whimpering like a child. Something <i class="calibre6">was</i> odd about Pattern, about his interactions with her all along. The way he covered up what happened in the past. The timeline of her past … disregarding the holes in it … didn’t quite work. It never had worked.…</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Strength, Shallan,</i> Veil thought.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Take over,</i> Shallan thought. <i class="calibre6">You can face this. It’s why you were created.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Try to keep going,</i> Veil thought, refusing to take over. <i class="calibre6">Just keep walking. You</i> can <i class="calibre6">do this.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">So Shallan reluctantly maintained control. When Adolin called a brief break two hours later, Shallan forced herself to make a quick sketch of the communication cube in its trunk. The Memory was perfect, and the details did not lie. The powder <i class="calibre6">had</i> been scuffed with finger marks. It was a very, very thin coating, almost invisible. But her Lightweaver ability allowed her to memorize such details.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan tried hard to ignore the problem, instead focusing on their surroundings, which had grown more uneven and rocky. The glass trees here were beautiful, like they were molten liquid, and made sweeping curls reminiscent of crashing waves. Yes, focus on those. That beauty.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She was particularly thrilled when she spotted what had to be Lasting <span aria-label="461" id="pg_461" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Integrity: a large fortress on a bleak outcrop of obsidian jutting out into the bead ocean. Imperious—with high walls crafted of some uniformly blue stone—the large boxy fortress was positioned perfectly to defend a natural bay to the north. You even had to cross a bridge to reach the place. Honorspren, it was clear, did not take fortification lightly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan wanted to draw it. She could lose herself in the picture and not have to confront other facts. But then Pattern walked up beside her, and she instead whimpered and retreated again.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil at last took control. For Shallan’s own good.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We are almost arrived!” Pattern said, his pattern rotating in an intensely excited manner.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil needed proof, so she chose her words deliberately. “I’ve been thinking a lot about your early days with Shallan. It seems possible that the Ghostbloods were watching her when she was a child. If we can discover facts to confirm this, it might help us figure out how to beat them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Mm. That makes sense, I suppose!” he said. “I don’t remember much though.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You were together once, in the garden, with Shallan,” Veil said—fabricating a complete lie. “I can see her memories. Shallan saw Balat speaking to someone who looked, in hindsight, like she might have been wearing a mask. Do you suppose <i class="calibre6">he</i> might be the spy?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Oh!” Pattern said. “Your brother? Working with the Ghostbloods? Hmmm … That would be painful for you! But maybe it makes sense. Mraize always <i class="calibre6">does</i> seem to know too much about your brothers and where they are.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Do you remember that day in Shallan’s past?” Veil pushed. “Anything about it?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“In the garden, with Balat meeting someone wearing a mask…” Pattern said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“An important moment,” Veil said. “You were there. I can remember you being with Shallan.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Um … Yes!” he said. “I remember now. Ha ha. Yes, that happened. Balat and a mysterious figure. You have made my memory start to return, Veil! We were together then. And maybe Balat <i class="calibre6">is</i> a spy. My my. That is very naughty of him.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">From deep inside, Shallan whimpered again. But Veil, Veil had been <i class="calibre6">created</i> to soldier through moments like this. She ignored the profound sickening feeling. Pattern was lying to her.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Pattern</i> was <i class="calibre6">lying.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil couldn’t take anything for granted any longer. She couldn’t assume <i class="calibre6">anyone</i> was trustworthy. She had to be careful, redouble her defenses, and keep Shallan safe.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="462" id="pg_462" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Veil?” Pattern asked. “Are you well? Did I say something wrong?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m merely thinking,” Veil said. “Have you seen any strange spren watching us?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The corrupted gloryspren?” he asked. “Like you said to watch out for? No, I have not. Mmm…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She saw something ahead, a small group of riders glowing a faint blue-white. The honorspren had seen them approaching, and had sent a contingent to engage them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin halted the column, dismounting and telling his soldiers to water the horses and settle everyone. Then he stepped forward, still wearing the bloodied uniform, his side bandaged.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil moved to follow. “Keep your eyes—or whatever it is you have—open,” she said to Pattern as he ambled along beside her. “These are dangerous times, Pattern. We have to always be on the watch. Careful, lest we be taken advantage of…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, truly.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan grew very small, very quiet. <i class="calibre6">It’s all right,</i> Veil thought. <i class="calibre6">I’ll figure it out. I’ll find a way to keep you safe. I promise.</i></p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Adolin stopped in front of his caravan, Shallan at his side. The pain medication he’d taken was working, and he felt only a small ache from his gut wound. And the march here—during which he’d admitted he needed to ride, letting him rest—had helped with his light-headedness.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He still required sleep and time to recover. This wound wouldn’t be debilitating, unless it started to rot. But he also wouldn’t be in fighting shape for weeks at least.</p>
<p class="fmtx">For now, he kept a strong front. He had Notum stay back, though he was certain the three approaching honorspren had seen him. They rode on those same graceful not-horses that Notum had been riding earlier. His had run off in a panic when he’d been attacked, and they hadn’t been able to locate it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">These newcomers wore sharp field uniforms after an unfamiliar style—long sweeping coats that trailed almost to the knees, with high collars. They wore crowns on their heads, and carried long swords at their sides, slim and beautiful. The swords were the only things they wore that weren’t made of their own substance—coats, crowns, shirts, all were simply created by the honorspren.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A woman at the front had the highest collar of the three. She wore her hair up, tight save for one small tail of it pouring out the back. That, like the uniforms, was a fashion style unfamiliar to Adolin.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="463" id="pg_463" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She pulled her not-horse to a halt about five paces from him. “Human,” she said. “You’ve been recognized by our scouts. Are you Adolin Kholin, as we have surmised?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your intelligence is good,” he said to her, hand resting on his sheathed sword. “I’ve come by order of the Bondsmith, my father, to visit your lands and deliver a message on his behalf. I bring with me Knights Radiant of four different orders, all of whom work in concert against the rising Everstorm. Proof that men and spren once again need their bonds of old.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Lasting Integrity is not accepting visitors or emissaries, regardless of their pedigree,” the woman said, her tone sharp, each word a barked order. “You are to leave. We are not interested in bonds with murderers and traitors.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin took out the letters he’d been given, proffering them. He waited, sweating, hoping. One of the honorspren urged its mount forward, then took the letters.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin felt a wave of relief as the honorspren returned to the other two. “Those letters explain our position,” Adolin said. “My father hopes that we can forge a new—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He was interrupted as the spren deliberately ripped the letters in half. “We will not accept,” the woman said, “a contract from you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s not a contract!” Adolin said, stepping forward, ignoring a spike of pain from his side. “They’re just letters! At least read them!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“By reading these, we imply there is an argument you could make to persuade us,” the woman said as the other honorspren further shredded the letters. “You will withdraw from these lands and take with you the traitor Notum. Inform him that we now know his complicities run deeper than anticipated. His exile is complete.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin gritted his teeth. “He was attacked,” he said. “Nearly killed before we could get there! The world is changing. Barricading yourselves in your fortress won’t stop the change, but it might leave you completely without allies when you finally realize you need to do something!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The honorspren unsheathed her sword and pointed it at him. “This is our realm. Our sovereign land. So you will leave as ordered. Humans never respect that, never accept that spren can <i class="calibre6">own</i> anything. We are possessions to you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You will <i class="calibre6">leave,</i>” she said. “We reject your offer! We reject your bonds!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin took a deep breath, each of his arguments dying like shriveled plants starved for rainwater. Until only one dangerous possibility remained. A plan he had barely dared consider, let alone suggest to the others.</p>
<p class="fmtx">When he spoke, it was with the same brashness—but the same sense of instinctive <i class="calibre6">rightness</i>—that had led him to attack Sadeas. “You mistake <span aria-label="464" id="pg_464" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>me!” he snapped at the honorspren. “I didn’t come to offer you bonds with Radiants.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What, then?” she demanded.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ve come,” Adolin said, “to face your judgment. You’ve named us murderers, traitors. I reject this, and vow to prove it. Take me, as a representative of the Kholin house and the new government of Urithiru. I am a highprince of Alethkar and the son of the Bondsmith. I will stand in the place of those humans whom you say betrayed you. You wish to reject <i class="calibre6">us</i> because of what <i class="calibre6">they</i> did? Prove, through judgment, that <i class="calibre6">I</i> deserve this treatment.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The lead honorspren fell silent, then she leaned to the side and whispered quickly to her companions. They seemed equally baffled. Behind, Shallan took Adolin by the arm on his good side, her face concerned.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He stood firm. Not because he was confident, but because he was angry. They wanted to call him a traitor? They wanted to blame <i class="calibre6">him</i> for what had been done to Maya? Well, they were honorspren. He suspected they wouldn’t be able to resist a chance to formally defend their honor—as they saw it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You would stand trial?” the honorspren said at last. “For your ancestors?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will stand trial for myself. In turning me away, you insult my sense of dignity, my integrity. You say I am not worthy, when you do not know me?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We know humans,” one said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I reject that argument. Honor demands you let me speak for myself, if you are going to punish me. Where is the trial? Where is the chance for me to speak? Where is your <i class="calibre6">honor</i>?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">This provoked a reaction at last. The three began looking at one another.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You are honorspren, are you not?” Adolin said. “You believe in justice? In fairness? Let’s see if you can uphold those ideals while blaming <i class="calibre6">me</i> for what was done in the past. Let me speak for myself. Then <i class="calibre6">prove</i> that I, Adolin Kholin, deserve to be turned away.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Finally the leader sat up straight in her saddle. “Very well. We cannot reject a demand for judgment. Come with us. Know that if you enter Lasting Integrity, there is little chance of you ever leaving.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We shall see,” Adolin said, then turned and waved to beckon the others.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No,” the honorspren said. “Just you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My party has traveled far,” Adolin said, “and they include representatives of—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You may bring two others,” the honorspren said. “And that deadeye. You have bound her corpse, haven’t you, human? You’re not one of these new Radiants? Or have you already killed your spren?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="465" id="pg_465" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I’m not a Radiant,” Adolin said. “But yes, Maya is my Blade.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Then we must be certain you are not mistreating her,” the honorspren said. “We care for all deadeyes. Bring her, and two others. Decide quickly.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin ground his teeth. “Allow me to confer.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">As he and Shallan returned to the others, she seized him by the arm. “What are you doing?” she demanded. “You can’t stand trial for what a bunch of people did thousands of years ago.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will if it gets us in those gates,” Adolin said. “Do we have a choice?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes,” she said. “We could turn back.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">And face my father, having failed him again?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">The others gathered around him. Adolin explained what was happening, the Stump’s spren translating for her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t like this,” Zu said, shaking her head, her golden hair shimmering. “I don’t like splitting us up.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The first step to completing this mission is getting the honorspren to talk to me,” Adolin said. “If they turn us away here, we’re done. If I can get through those gates, I can maybe start a conversation.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They’re not going to listen to you, Brightlord,” Godeke said. “They’re going to arrest you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“If it gets me in, I don’t particularly care. We’ll send a small group back immediately to tell my father what I’ve done. The rest can camp out here for a few days, care for Notum, and wait for word from me. We have a few weeks until supplies make it necessary for you to return; we’ll decide what to do then.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The others offered a few more token objections. Shallan—actually, she seemed like Veil right now—merely listened as Adolin persuaded the others. She plainly knew he would take her in with him, as well as her spren. It seemed the natural choice.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A short time later he approached the honorspren—leading Gallant, with Maya on his back—along with Veil, Pattern, and their trunks of clothing on pack animals.
