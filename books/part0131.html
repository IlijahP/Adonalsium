<p class="tni">A banging came on the door, and Eshonai pulled it open and stared out into a tempest. Grand lightning flashes shattered the blackness in brief emotional bouts, revealing Venli, her eyes wide, grinning and soaked, clutching something in two hands before her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She stumbled into the room, trailing water—which caused their mother to chide her. Jaxlim was in one of her … episodes where she saw the two of them as children.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli—seemingly oblivious to anything other than the gemstone—wandered past their mother. She rubbed her thumb on the gemstone, which was about a third the size of her fist.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Storms,” Eshonai said, pushing the door closed. “You did it?” She set the beam in place, then left it rattling in the wind as she stepped over to Venli.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But … no, the gemstone wasn’t glowing. Was it? Eshonai leaned closer. It <i class="calibre6">was</i> glowing, but barely.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It worked,” Venli whispered to Awe, clutching the stone. “It <i class="calibre6">finally</i> worked. The secret <i class="calibre6">is</i> lightning, Eshonai! It pulls them through. When I drew close enough right after a strike, I found <i class="calibre6">hundreds</i> of them. I snagged this one before the others returned to the other side.…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The other side?” Eshonai asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli didn’t respond. She seemed like a different person lately, always exhausted from working long nights—and from her insistence on going out in each and every storm to try to capture a stormspren. And now this. Venli cradled the gemstone, ignoring the water streaming from her clothing.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="979" id="pg_979" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Venli?” Eshonai said. “If you want my help in bringing this to the Five, you will need to let me see what you’ve done.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli stared at her, quiet, no rhythm at all. Then she stood tall and hummed to Confidence, proffering the gemstone. Eshonai attuned Curiosity and took it. Yes … it did have a spren inside, though it glowed with an odd light. Too dark, almost dusty. Smoky. It was difficult to tell its color through the green of the emerald, but it seemed shadowed, like lightning deep within the clouds.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This spren is unlike any I’ve ever seen,” Eshonai said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Stormform,” Venli whispered. “Power.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Dangerous power. This could destroy the listeners.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Eshonai,” Venli said to Reprimand, “our people are already <i class="calibre6">being</i> destroyed. Don’t you think that this time, instead of making a snap decision based on songs from thousands of years ago, we should at least <i class="calibre6">try</i> a different solution?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rumbling thunder outside seemed to agree with Venli’s words. Eshonai handed the gemstone back, then hummed to Betrayal to indicate what she thought of Venli’s argument. But the rhythm didn’t express how deeply the words cut.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Turning her back on her sister, Eshonai walked to the door again and threw aside the bar. Ignoring both Venli and her mother as they cried objections, Eshonai stepped out into the storm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The wind hit her hard, but in warform’s armor she barely felt the icy raindrops. She stood in the light spilling from the door until Venli pushed it closed, plunging Eshonai into darkness.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She attuned the Rhythm of Winds and started walking. Humans feared the storms. They always hid indoors. Eshonai respected the storms, and usually preferred to meet them with a stormshield. But she did not fear them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She walked away from her mother’s house, eastward into the wind. These days, her life had constantly been against the wind. It blew so hard, she barely felt she was making progress. Maybe she’d have been better off letting it steer her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">If she hadn’t fought so much—if she hadn’t spent so much time thinking about her explorations or her dreams—would she have settled into her role as general faster? If she’d doubled down on her raids at the start, would she have been able to shove the humans out of the warcamps before they got a foothold?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Like a rockbud, humans were. Soft at first, but capable of gripping onto the stone and growing into something practically immovable. In this—despite their lack of rhythms—they belonged to Roshar better than the <span aria-label="980" id="pg_980" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>listeners did. If she could truly travel the world, would she find them growing in every crevice?</p>
<p class="fmtx">She neared the edge of the plateau that made up the central heart of Narak, the city of exile. She walked carefully, letting flashes of lightning guide her way. She stepped right up to the edge of the chasm, facing into the wind.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What do you want from us?” she shouted. “Answer me, Rider! Spren of the storm! You’re a traitor like us, aren’t you? Is that why you sent Venli those little spren?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The wind blasted her, as if to push her off balance. Debris spun and sputtered in the wind, spiraling around her—the lightning making each piece seem frozen in the moment. A quick sequence of bolts struck nearby, and the thunder vibrated and rattled her carapace. Absolute darkness followed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">At first she thought maybe the Rider of Storms had chosen to appear to her. However, this darkness was ordinary. She could still feel the wind, rain, and debris.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What kind of choice is this?” she demanded. “Either we let the humans destroy us, or we turn away from the <i class="calibre6">one</i> thing that defines us? The one value that matters?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Darkness. Rain. Wind. But no reply.</p>
<p class="fmtx">What had she expected? An actual answer? Was this a prayer, then? Didn’t make a lot of sense, considering that the very thing she resisted was a return to her people’s old gods.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Those gods had never deserved reverence. What was a god who only made demands? Nothing but a tyrant with a different name.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Everything I’ve done,” she said into the wind, “has been to ensure we remain our own people. That’s all I want. I gave up my dreams. But I will not give up our minds.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Brave words. Useless words. They would have to take Venli’s discovery to the Five, and they would have to let her test it. Eshonai knew that as well as she knew the Rhythm of Peace. They couldn’t reject a potential new form now.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She turned to go, then heard something. Rock scraping on rock? Was the plateau cracking? Though she could barely hear it, the noise must be quite loud to reach her over the din of the tempest.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai stepped backward—but her footing seemed unsteady, and she didn’t want to move without a flash of lightning to guide her. What if—</p>
<p class="fmtx">Branching light flashed in the heavens far to the east. It lit the sky white, highlighting debris, illuminating the land around her. Everything except for an enormous shadow silhouetted in front of her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai’s breath caught. The rhythms froze in her head. That shape … <span aria-label="981" id="pg_981" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>sinuous, yet massive. Claws as thick as her body gripping the rim of the chasm mere feet in front of her. It couldn’t be—</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lightning flashed again, and she saw its face. A chasmfiend snout, with jagged swords for teeth, head cocked to the side to watch her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She didn’t run. If it wanted her, she was already dead. Prey ran, and the beasts were known to play with things that acted like prey, even if they weren’t hungry. Still, standing there in pitch-darkness—not daring to attune a rhythm—was the hardest thing she’d ever done.</p>
<p class="fmtx">When the lightning next flashed, the chasmfiend had lowered its incredible head toward her, its eye close enough that she could have stabbed it without needing to lunge.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Darkness fell. Then a small burst of light appeared directly ahead of her. A small spren made of white fire. It zipped forward, trailing an afterimage. Like a falling star. It moved closer, then spun around her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">By its light, she could see the chasmfiend slowly retreat into the chasm, its spikelike claws leaving scores on the stone. Her heart beating like thunder, Eshonai attuned Anxiety and hurried home. The strange little spren followed her.</p>
