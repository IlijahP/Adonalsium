<p class="lti"><span aria-label="901" id="pg_901" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">Jezrien is gone. Despite being all the way out here in Lasting Integrity, I felt him being ripped away. The Oathpact was broken already, but the Connection remained. Each of us can sense the others, to an extent. And with further investigation, I know the truth of what happened to him. It felt like death at first, and I think that is what it ultimately became.</span></p>
<p class="tni">Rlain stepped into the laundry room, and felt every single <i class="calibre6">storming</i> head in the place turn to look at him. The singer guards at the door perked up, one nudging the other and humming to Curiosity. Human women working the large tubs of sudsy water turned as they scrubbed. Men who were toiling at bleaching vats—with long poles to move the cloth inside—stopped and wiped brows. Chatter became whispers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain. Traitor. Reject. Oddity.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He kept his head high—he hadn’t lived through Bridge Four to be intimidated by a quiet room and staring eyes—but he couldn’t help feeling like he was the one gemstone in the pile that didn’t glow. Somehow, with the singers invading Urithiru, he’d become <i class="calibre6">more</i> of an outsider.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He strode past the vats and tubs to the drying station. Some of the tower’s original fabrials—the lifts, the main wells, the air vents—had been altered to work with Voidlight. That meant the workers here could set out large racks for drying in this room where the vents blew a little stronger. There was talk that the Fused would get other fabrials in the tower working soon, but Rlain wasn’t privy to their timelines.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Near the drying racks he found a small cart waiting for him, filled with <span aria-label="902" id="pg_902" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>clean bedding. He counted the sheets as the foreman—a lighteyed human who always seemed to be standing around when Rlain visited—leaned against the wall nearby, folding his arms.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So,” he said to Rlain, “what’s it like? Roaming the tower. Ruling the place. Pretty good, eh?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t rule anything,” Rlain said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Sure, sure. Must feel good though, being in charge of all those people who used to own you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m a listener,” Rlain said to Irritation. “I was never an Alethi slave, just a spy pretending to be one.” Well, except for Bridge Four. That had felt like <i class="calibre6">true</i> slavery.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“But your people are in charge now,” the man prodded, completely unable to take a hint.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They aren’t my people,” Rlain said. “I’m a listener—I come from an <i class="calibre6">entirely</i> different country. I’m as much one of them as <i class="calibre6">you</i> are an Iriali.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The man scratched his head at that. Rlain sighed and wheeled the cart over to pick up some pillows. The women there didn’t usually talk to him, so he was able to pile up the pillows without getting more than a few scowls.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He <i class="calibre6">could</i> hear their whispers, unfortunately. Better than they probably thought he could.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“… Don’t speak too loudly,” one was saying. “He’ll report you to them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He was here all along,” another hissed. “Watching the Windrunners, planning when best to strike. He’s the one who poisoned them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Hovers over them like a vengeful spren,” a third said. “Watching to kill any who wake up. Any who—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She squealed as Rlain spun toward the three women. Their eyes opened wide and they drew back. Rlain could <i class="calibre6">feel</i> their tension as he walked up to them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I like cards,” he said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The three stared at him in horror.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Cards,” Rlain said to Longing. “I’m best at towers, but I like runaround too. I’m pretty good, you know. Bisig says it’s because I’m good at bluffing. I find it fun. I <i class="calibre6">like</i> it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The three women exchanged looks, obviously confused.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I thought you should know something about me,” Rlain said. “I figured maybe if you did, you would stop making things up.” He nodded to them, then forcibly attuned Peace as he went back to tie the pillows into place on the top of his cart. As he began wheeling it away, the whispers started again.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You heard him,” the first woman hissed. “He’s a gambler! Of course. <span aria-label="903" id="pg_903" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">Those</i> kind can see the <i class="calibre6">future,</i> you know. Foul powers of the Void. He likes to take advantage of those unwise enough to bet against him.…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain sighed, but kept going. At the door, he knew to step to the side as one of the singer guards tried to trip him. They hadn’t tired of that same old terrible trick—no matter how many times he visited. He shoved his way out the door quickly, but not before one of them called, “See you tomorrow, traitor!” to the Rhythm of Reprimand.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain pushed the cart through the halls of Urithiru. There were a lot of people out, both human and singer. Bringing water from the wells was a full-time duty for many hundreds of workers. A lot of the population had moved away from the perimeter, which was growing too cold. Instead they crowded together into these interior rooms.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Humans gave way for him. Most of the singers didn’t glance at him, but those who did usually noticed his tattoo. Their rhythms changed, and their eyes followed him. Some hated him for the treason of his ancestors. Others had been told the listeners were a brave frontrunner group who had prepared for Odium’s return. These treated Rlain with reverence.</p>
<p class="fmtx">In the face of it all—the frightened humans, the mistrusting Regals, the occasionally awed ordinary singers—he wished he could simply be <i class="calibre6">Rlain.</i> He hated that to every one of them, he was some kind of representation of an entire people. He wanted to be seen as a person, not a symbol.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The closest he’d come had been among the men of Bridge Four. Even though they’d named him “Shen,” of all things. That was like naming one of their children “Human.” But for all their faults, they had succeeded in giving him a home. Because they’d been willing to try to see him for himself.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As he pushed his cart, he caught sight of that cremling again. The nondescript brown one that would scuttle along walls near the ceiling, blending in with the stonework. They were still watching him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli had warned him about this. Voidspren invisibility didn’t work properly in the tower. So it appeared that, to keep an eye on someone here, they’d begun entering an animal’s gemheart. He tried to pretend he hadn’t seen it. Eventually, it turned and scuttled down a different hallway. Voidspren weren’t fully able to control the animals they bonded; though apparently the dumber the animal, the easier they were to influence. So there was no way of telling if the Voidspren had decided it had seen enough for the day, or if its host was merely distracted.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain eventually reached the atrium, and like many people, he briefly basked in the light coming through the large eastern window. There was always a lot of traffic in here these days. Though only the privileged among the singers were allowed to use the lifts, people of both species came here for light.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="904" id="pg_904" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>He crossed the atrium with his cart, then pushed it through into the Radiant infirmary. He still couldn’t relax—as a surprising number of humans moved through the room among the unconscious Radiants.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Ostensibly they all had a reason to be there. Water carriers, people to change the bedpans, others recruited to help feed broth to the Radiants. There were always new volunteers—the men and women of the tower were turning coming here into some kind of pilgrimage. Look in on the Radiants. Care for them. Then go burn prayers for them to recover. None of the people working in here seemed bothered by the fact that—not two years ago—they would have cursed by the Lost Radiants.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eyes chased Rlain as he—forcing himself to walk to the beat of the Rhythm of Peace—delivered the cart of freshly laundered sheets and pillows to those changing them. A man with one arm and haunted eyes was overseeing this work today. Like most of the others in the room, he’d painted his forehead with the <i class="calibre6">shash</i> glyph. That baffled Rlain.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A few days ago, Lezian the Pursuer had ordered his men to beat those who wore the forehead mark—though only a day later, that order had been reversed by Raboniel. Still seemed strange that so many humans would wear the thing. They had to realize they were singling themselves out.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Though he’d been forced to rein in his men, and there had been fewer incidents recently, the Pursuer continued to push for more brutality in the tower. Unnervingly, he’d placed a few guards here in the infirmary: two stormform Regals currently, on rotation with several other Regals, who stood watch at all hours.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain felt their stares on him as he walked to the back of the room where Lirin and Hesina had used hanging sheets to section off a part as a kind of office and living quarters for themselves. Rlain forced himself to attune Confidence until he could step between the sheets.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Inside he found Lirin peeking out at the stormforms. A small surgery station was set up behind him, where Lirin could see patients—because of course he needed to do that. Kaladin had spoken of his father, and Rlain felt he knew Lirin and Hesina, though he’d interacted with them in person for only a few weeks.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Well?” Rlain asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The stormforms have seen me and Hesina,” Lirin whispered. “We couldn’t stay hidden all the time. But I don’t think it matters. By this point, <i class="calibre6">someone</i> must have recognized us. I wouldn’t be surprised if those Regals were sent here in the first place because this ‘Pursuer’ discovered we were here.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Maybe you should remain quiet,” Rlain said, searching the ceiling for cremlings. “Or maybe we should get you out.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’ve been watching for cremlings,” Lirin said. “And haven’t seen any. <span aria-label="905" id="pg_905" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Nothing so far. As for the Pursuer, Venli says that we should be safe from him, so long as that Heavenly One, Leshwi, protects us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t know how much I trust any of them, Lirin,” Rlain said. “Particularly Fused.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Agreed,” Lirin said. “What games are they playing? Leshwi didn’t even ask after my son. Do you have any idea why they are acting this way?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Sorry,” Rlain said. “I’m baffled. Our songs barely mention the Fused except to say to avoid them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin grunted. Like the others, he seemed to expect Rlain to understand the Fused and Regals more than he did—but to the surgeon’s credit, he and Hesina had accepted Rlain without suspicion, despite his race. For all that Lirin complained about Kaladin, it seemed he considered someone his son called a friend to be worthy of trust.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And Venli?” Lirin asked. “She wears a Regal form. Can we trust her?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Venli could have left me in prison,” Rlain said. “I think she’s proven herself.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Unless it’s a long con of some sort,” Lirin said, his eyes narrowing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain hummed to Reconciliation. “I’m surprised to hear of your suspicion. Kaladin said you always saw the best in people.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My son doesn’t know me nearly as well as he presumes,” Lirin said. He continued standing by the drapes.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain made his way past the surgery table to where Hesina had set out one of his stolen maps on the floor. There, he hummed to Anxiety. “Maybe we shouldn’t have these out,” he whispered. “With those Regals around.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We can’t live our lives terrified of enemies at every corner, Rlain,” Hesina said. “If they wanted to take us, they’d have done it already. We have to assume we’re safe, for now.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain hummed to Anxiety. But … there was wisdom in her words. He forced himself to calm. He had seen that cremling, yes, but didn’t <i class="calibre6">know</i> it had a Voidspren. Perhaps he <i class="calibre6">was</i> jumping at shadows. Likely, he was just on edge because of the way everyone treated him during his trips through the tower.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I keep thinking,” Hesina said, looking over the map, “that if we could get this to Kal, it might help.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain glanced at Lirin, humming to Curiosity. Hesina wouldn’t catch the rhythm, but she clearly understood his body language.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Lirin’s dispute is not mine,” Hesina said. “He can play the stoic pacifist all he wants—and I’ll love him for it. But I’m not going to leave Kal out there alone with no help. You think if he had exact maps of the tower, he might have a better chance?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Couldn’t hurt,” Rlain said, kneeling beside her. They’d all heard about what Kaladin had done the other day—appearing spectacularly in the Breakaway market, engaging the Fused, fighting in the air.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="906" id="pg_906" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The Fused were obviously frightened. They had immediately started publicizing that they’d killed him. Too quickly, and too forcefully, without a body to show. The people of the tower weren’t buying it, and neither was Rlain. He’d joined Bridge Four later than most, but he’d been there for Kaladin’s most dramatic transformations. Stormblessed was alive in the tower somewhere, planning his next move.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Hesina continued to pore over the map of the tower’s sixth floor—but Rlain noticed something else. Hesina had set another map aside, one of the Shattered Plains. Rlain unrolled it fully and found himself attuning the Rhythm of the Lost. He’d never seen a full map, this detailed, of the entire Plains.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The immensity didn’t surprise him. He’d been out there as both listener and bridgeman. He’d flown with the Windrunners. He understood the scope of the Shattered Plains, and was prepared for Narak to seem diminutive when compared to the expanse of plateaus stretching in all directions. But he wasn’t prepared for how <i class="calibre6">symmetrical</i> it all was, now that he could see it all at once.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Yes, the Plains had most definitely been broken in a pattern. He hummed to Curiosity as he peered closer, and he picked out some cramped writing on the far eastern side of the Plains—where the plateaus were worn smaller by the winds. That was the direction the chasmfiends migrated after breeding or pupating. A dangerous area full of greatshells, herd animals, and predators as large as buildings.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Hesina?” Rlain said, turning the map in her direction. “Can you read this part to me?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She leaned over. “Scout report,” she said. “They found a camp out there, it seems. Some kind of large caravan or nomadic group. Maybe they’re Natans? A lot of this area is unexplored, Rlain.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He hummed to himself, wondering if he should learn to read. Sigzil was always talking about how useful it was, though Rlain didn’t like the idea of relying on written words that had no life, instead of on songs. A piece of paper could be burned, lost, destroyed in a storm—but an entire people and their songs could not be so easily …</p>
<p class="fmtx">He trailed off. An entire people. It struck him anew that he was alone.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No, Venli is here,</i> he thought. There were two of them. He’d never particularly liked Venli, but at least he wasn’t the sole listener. It made him wonder. Should they … try to rebuild? The idea nauseated him for multiple reasons. For one, the times he’d tried mateform himself, things hadn’t gone the way he—or anyone really—had expected.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin abruptly pulled back from the curtains. His motion was so sudden that Hesina took it as a warning and immediately grabbed a sheet and pulled it over the maps. Then she laid out some bandages—to appear as <span aria-label="907" id="pg_907" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>if she’d spread the sheet onto the floor to keep the bandages clean as she rolled them. It was an excellent cover-up—one Rlain ruined by belatedly moving to tuck away his map of the Shattered Plains.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s not that,” Lirin said, grabbing Rlain by the shoulder. “Come look. I think I recognize one of the workers.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin pointed out through the drapes, directing Rlain toward a short man. He had a mark on his forehead, but it wasn’t an inked <i class="calibre6">shash</i> glyph. It was a Bridge Four tattoo like Rlain’s own. Dabbid kept his eyes down, walking with his characteristic sense of mute subservience.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I think that man was one of Kaladin’s friends,” Lirin said. “Am I right?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain nodded, then hummed softly to Anxiety and stepped out into the main room. He and Dabbid had often been set to work together as the only two members of Bridge Four who hadn’t gained Windrunner abilities. Seeing him opened that wound again for Rlain, and he hummed forcibly to Peace.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It wasn’t his fault that spren were as racist as humans. Or as singers. As people.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He quietly took Dabbid by the arm, steering him away from the Regals. “Storms, I’m glad to see you,” Rlain whispered. “I was worried about you, Dabbid. Where have you been? Were you frightened? Here, come help me bring some water to the others. Like the work we used to do, remember?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He could imagine the poor mute hiding in a corner, crying as enemies flooded the tower. Dabbid had become kind of a mascot for Bridge Four. One of the first men Kaladin had saved. Dabbid represented what had been done to them, and the fact that they’d survived it. Wounded, but still alive.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid resisted as Rlain tugged him toward the water trough. The shorter bridgeman leaned in, then—remarkably—<i class="calibre6">spoke.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Rlain,” Dabbid said. “Please help. Kaladin is asleep, and he won’t wake up. I think … I think he’s dying.”</p>
