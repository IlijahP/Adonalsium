<p class="tni">Venli could hear new rhythms. She tried to hide this fact, attuning the old, boring rhythms around others. It was so <i class="calibre6">difficult.</i> The new rhythms were her majesty, the proof that she was special. She wanted to shout them, <i class="calibre6">flaunt</i> them.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Quiet,</i> Ulim said from her gemheart. <i class="calibre6">Quiet for now, Venli. There will be time enough later to enjoy the Rhythm of Praise.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">She attuned Exultation, but did not hum it as she walked through the room where her scholars worked. Ulim had given her hints about finding another form, nimbleform. He wouldn’t tell her the exact process yet, so she’d gathered these scholars and set them to work.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Over time, she intended to use them as an excuse to reveal many important discoveries. Including ones that Ulim had promised her. Greater forms than these. Power.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">You are special,</i> Ulim whispered as she idled near a pair of her scholars who were trying to trap a windspren that had flown in to tease them. <i class="calibre6">I could sense you from far away, Venli. You were chosen by our god, the true god of all singers. He sent me to explain how wonderful you are.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">The words comforted her. Yes. That was right. She <i class="calibre6">would</i> wear forms of power. Only … hadn’t she once wanted those … for her mother? Wasn’t that the point?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">You will be great,</i> he said within her gemheart. <i class="calibre6">Everyone will recognize your majesty.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Well, I want nimbleform soon,” she whispered to Ulim, stepping out of the chamber. “It has been too long since warform. My sister and her sycophants get to tromp around the cities on display like heroes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="846" id="pg_846" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">Let them. Those are your grunts, who will be sent to die fighting the humans once our plot is accomplished. You should take time “finding” nimbleform. It will be too suspicious for you to find another so soon.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">She folded her arms, listening to the new rhythm praise her. The city buzzed with activity, thousands of listeners from a dozen families passing by. Eshonai and the others had made great strides toward true unity, and the elders of the various families were talking to one another.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Who would get the glory for that? Venli had orchestrated this grand convergence, but everyone <i class="calibre6">ignored</i> her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Perhaps she should have taken warform. Ulim had urged her to be one of the first, but she’d hesitated. She hadn’t been frightened, no, but she’d assumed she could manipulate better without taking the form.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That had been a mistake, and this was her reward: Eshonai taking all the credit. Next time, Venli would do it herself.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ulim,” she whispered, “when will the other Voidspren be ready?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Can’t say for certain,</i> he replied. <i class="calibre6">That stupid Herald is still standing strong all these years later. We have to work around him.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“The new storm,” Venli whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Yes. It’s been building in Shadesmar for centuries. We need to get our agents close enough to it on this side—a place that is out in the ocean, mind you—so they can use gemstones to pull my brothers and sisters across. Then those stones have to be physically transported here. You have no idea how much of a pain it all is.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m well acquainted by now,” she said to Derision. “You never shut up about it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Hey, you’re the only one I get to talk to. And I like to talk. So …</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Nimbleform. When?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We have bigger problems. Your people aren’t ready to accept forms of power. At all. They’re far too timid. And the way they fight …</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“What’s wrong with the way we fight?” Venli asked to Conceit. “Our warriors are powerful and intimidating.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Please,</i> Ulim replied. <i class="calibre6">The humans have remembered how to make good steel all these centuries, and even figured out some things we never learned. Meanwhile, your people throw spears at each other like primitives. They yell and dance more than they fight. It’s embarrassing.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Maybe you should have gone to the humans then.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Don’t be childish,</i> Ulim said. <i class="calibre6">You need to know what you’re facing. Imagine a hundred thousand men in glistening armor, moving in coordinated blocks, lifting a wall of interlocking shields—broken only by the spears coming out to bite your flesh.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Imagine thousands upon thousands of archers loosing waves of arrows that sweep in a deadly rain. Imagine men on horseback charging—thunder without</i> <span aria-label="847" id="pg_847" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">lightning—and riding down anyone in their path. You think you can face that with a few semicoherent boasts?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli’s confidence wavered. She looked out toward the Shattered Plains, where their warforms trained on a nearby plateau. She’d nudged them toward that, following Ulim’s suggestions. He knew a lot about manipulating people; with his help she could get the others to do pretty much anything.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A part of her thought she should be concerned about that. But when she tried to think along those lines, her mind grew fuzzy. And she ended up circling back to whatever she’d been thinking about before.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Eshonai guesses that the humans are bluffing about how many cities they have,” she said. “But if they have dozens like they told us, then our numbers would be roughly equal. If we can get all the families to listen to us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Roughly equal?</i> Ulim said, then started laughing. An outrageous sound, uproarious. It made her gemheart vibrate. <i class="calibre6">You and them? Even? Oh, you blessed little idiot.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli felt herself attune Agony. She <i class="calibre6">hated</i> the way he made her feel sometimes. He’d whisper about how great she was, but then they’d get deep into a conversation and he’d speak more freely. More derogatorily.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Well,” she said, “maybe we don’t have to fight them. Maybe we can find another way.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Kid, you’re not gonna have a choice on that one,</i> Ulim said. <i class="calibre6">They will make sure of it. You know what they’ve done to all the other singers in the world? They’re slaves.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes,” Venli said. “Proof that my ancestors were wise in leaving.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Yeah, please don’t say that around any of my friends,</i> Ulim said. <i class="calibre6">You’ll make me look bad. Your ancestors were traitors. And no matter what you do, the humans will make you fight. Trust me. It’s what they always do.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Your primitive little paradise here is doomed. Best you can do is train some soldiers, practice using the terrain to your advantage, and prepare to get some actual forms. You don’t get to choose to be free, Venli. Just which master to follow.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli pushed off from the wall and began walking through the city. Something was wrong about Ulim. About her. About the way she thought now …</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">You have no idea the power that awaits you, Venli,</i> Ulim said to the Rhythm of Craving. <i class="calibre6">In the old days, forms of power were reserved for the most special. The most valuable. They were strong, capable of amazing feats.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Then how did we ever lose?” she asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Bah, it was a fluke. We couldn’t break the last Herald, and the humans found some way to pin the whole Oathpact on him. So we got stuck on Braize. Eventually the Unmade decided to start a war without us. That turned out to be exceedingly</i> <span aria-label="848" id="pg_848" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">stupid. In the past, Odium granted forms of power, but Ba-Ado-Mishram thought she could do it. Ended up handing out forms of power as easily as Fused give each other titles, Connected herself to the entire singer species. Became a little god. Too little.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“I … don’t understand.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I’ll bet you don’t. Basically, everyone relied way too much on an oversized spren. Trouble is, spren can get stuck in gemstones, and the humans figured this out. End result: Ba-Ado-Mishram got a really cramped prison, and everyone’s souls got seriously messed up.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">It will take something big to restore the minds of the singers around the world. So we’re going to prime the pump, so to speak, with your people. Get them into stormform and pull the big storm over from Shadesmar. Odium thinks it will work, and considering he’s anything but a</i> little <i class="calibre6">god, we are going to do what he says. It’s better than the alternative, which generally involves a lot of pain and the occasional flavorful dismemberment.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli nodded to some listeners passing by. Members of another family; she could tell by the colors of the bands on their braids and the type of gemstone bits in the men’s beards. Venli deliberately hummed one of the weak old rhythms for them to hear, but these newcomers didn’t give her a second glance despite her importance.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Patience,</i> Ulim said. <i class="calibre6">Once the Return arrives, you will be proclaimed as the one who initiated it—and you will be given everything you deserve as the most important of all listeners.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“You say my ancestors were traitors,” Venli whispered. “But you need us. If they hadn’t split off, you wouldn’t have us to use in your plot. You should bless what they did.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">They got lucky. Doesn’t mean they weren’t traitors.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Perhaps they knew what Ba-Ado-Mishram was going to do, and so they attuned Wisdom, not Betrayal, in their actions.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She knew the name, of course. As a keeper of songs, she knew the names of all nine Unmade—who were among the gods her people swore to never follow again. But the more she talked with Ulim, the less regard she gave the songs. The old listeners had memorized the wrong things. How could they retain the names of the Unmade, but forget something as simple as how to adopt workform?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Anyway, who cares what your ancestors did?</i> Ulim said. <i class="calibre6">We need to prepare your people for forms of power, then get them to summon Odium’s storm. Everything will take care of itself after that.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“That might be harder than you think, spren,” Venli said to Derision. She quieted her voice as another group of listeners passed. The city was so packed these days, you could barely find any peace to think.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="849" id="pg_849" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">Forms of power, Venli. The ability to reshape the world. Strength beyond anything you’ve ever dreamed of having.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">She stuffed her hands into the pockets of her robe as she reached the heart of the city. She hadn’t realized she was coming this way, to her family’s home. She stepped inside, and found her mother picking apart a rug she had woven. Jaxlim glanced up at Venli, jumping.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s only me,” Venli said to Peace.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I got it wrong again,” Jaxlim said, huddling over her rug. “Wrong every time…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli tried to attune Indifference, one of the new rhythms, but she couldn’t find it. Not here, not with her mother. She instead settled down on the floor, cross-legged, like she’d sat as a child when learning the songs.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Mother?” Venli asked to Praise. “Everyone makes mistakes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Why can’t I do anything <i class="calibre6">right</i> anymore?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Mother, can you tell me the first song?” Venli whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jaxlim kept picking at the rug.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You know it,” Venli said. “Days we sing. Days we once knew? Days of—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Days of pain,” Jaxlim said, to the Rhythm of Memories. “Days of loss. Days of glory.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli nodded as Jaxlim continued. This song was more of a chant, the original recitation of her people leaving the war. Leaving their gods. Striking out on their own.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">This is painful to hear,</i> Ulim noted. <i class="calibre6">Your people had</i> no idea <i class="calibre6">what they were doing.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli ignored him, listening, feeling the Rhythm of Memories. Feeling … like herself. This <i class="calibre6">had</i> all been about finding a way to help her mother, hadn’t it? At the start?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No,</i> she admitted. <i class="calibre6">That’s what you told yourself. But you want more. You’ve always wanted more.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">She knew forms changed the way a person thought. But was she in a new form now? Ulim had been dodgy in explaining it. Evidently she had a normal spren in her gemheart to give her workform—but Ulim was there too, crowding in. And he could speak to her, even hear what she was thinking.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">You single-handedly delivered warform to your people,</i> Ulim whispered. <i class="calibre6">Once you give them additional forms, they will revere you. Worship you.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">She wanted that respect. She wanted it so <i class="calibre6">badly.</i> But she forced herself to listen to what her ancestors had done, four hundred of them striking out alone, wearing dullform.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">The fools were inbred, then,</i> Ulim said. <i class="calibre6">No wonder …</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="850" id="pg_850" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“These people created us,” she whispered. Her mother continued singing, and didn’t seem to have heard the interruption. “They were <i class="calibre6">not</i> fools. They were heroes. Their <i class="calibre6">primary</i> teaching, preserved in everything we do, is to <i class="calibre6">never</i> let our gods rule us again. To never take up forms of power. To never serve Odium.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Then don’t serve him,</i> Ulim said. <i class="calibre6">Deal with him. You have something he needs—you can approach him from a place of power. Your ancestors were lowly things; that was why they wanted to leave. If they’d been at the top, like your people will be, they’d have never wanted such a thing.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli nodded. But she was more persuaded by other arguments. War <i class="calibre6">was</i> coming with the humans. She could feel it in the way their soldiers eyed her people’s weapons. They had enslaved those parshmen. They’d do the same to Venli’s people.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The ancient songs had become irrelevant the moment Eshonai had led the humans to the Shattered Plains. The listeners could no longer hide. Conflict <i class="calibre6">would</i> find them. It was no longer a choice between their gods or freedom. It was a choice between their gods and human slaving brands.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">How do we proceed?</i> Ulim asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli closed her eyes, listening to her mother’s words. Her ancestors had been desperate. “We will need to be equally desperate,” Venli whispered. “My people need to see what I have seen: that we can no longer remain as we have been.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">The humans</i> will <i class="calibre6">destroy them.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes. Help me prove it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I am your servant in this,</i> Ulim said to Subservience. <i class="calibre6">What do you propose?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli listened. Jaxlim’s voice cracked and she trailed off. Jaxlim had forgotten the song again. The older femalen turned away and cried softly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It broke Venli’s heart.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You have agents among the humans, Ulim?” Venli whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We do.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Can you communicate with them?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I have ways of doing so.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Have your agents influence those at the palace,” Venli said. “Get the Alethi to invite us to visit. Their king spoke of it before he left; he’s considering it already. We must bring our people there, then show them how powerful the humans are. We must overwhelm my people with our own insignificance.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She stood up, then went to comfort her mother.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We must make them afraid, Ulim,</i> Venli thought. <i class="calibre6">We must make them sing to the Terrors long into the night. Only then will they listen to our promises.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">It shall be done,</i> he replied.</p>
