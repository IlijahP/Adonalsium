<p class="ep"><span aria-label="1039" id="pg_1039" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">As one who has suffered for so many centuries … as one whom it broke … please find Mishram and release her. Not just for her own good. For the good of all spren.</span></p>
<p class="ltsai"><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">For I believe that in confining her, we have caused a greater wound to Roshar than any ever realized.</span></p>
<p class="tni">Navani entered a feverish kind of study—a frantic near madness—as the work consumed her. Before, she had organized. Now she merely fed the beast. She barely slept.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The answer was here. The answer <i class="calibre6">meant</i> something. She couldn’t explain why, but she <i class="calibre6">needed</i> this secret.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Food became a distraction. Time stopped mattering. She put her clocks away so they wouldn’t remind her of human constructs like minutes and hours. She was searching for something deeper. More important.</p>
<p class="fmtx">These actions horrified a part of her. She <i class="calibre6">was</i> still herself, the type of woman who put her socks in the drawer so they all faced the same direction. She loved patterns, she loved order. But in this quest for meaning, she found she could appreciate something else entirely. The raw, <i class="calibre6">dis</i>organized chaos of a brain making connections paired with the single-minded order of a quest for one all-consuming answer.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Could she find the opposite to Voidlight?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Stormlight and Voidlight had their own kind of polarity. They were attracted to tones like iron shavings to a magnet. Therefore, she needed a tone that would push light <i class="calibre6">away.</i> She needed an opposite sound.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She wanted fluid tones, so she had a slide whistle delivered, along with <span aria-label="1040" id="pg_1040" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>a brass horn with a movable tube. However, she liked the sound of the plates best. They were difficult to increment, but she could order new ones cut and crafted quickly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Her study morphed from music theory—where some philosophers said that the true opposite of sound was silence—to mathematics. Mathematics taught that there were numbers associated with tones—frequencies, wavelengths.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Music, at its most fundamental level, <i class="calibre6">was math.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">She played the tone that represented the sound of Voidlight again and again, embedding it into her mind. She dreamed it when she slept. She played it first thing when she arose, watching the patterns of sand it made on a metal plate. Dancing grains, bouncing up and down, settling into peaks and troughs.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The opposite of most numbers was a negative number. Could a tone be negative? Could there be a negative wavelength? Many such ideas couldn’t exist in the real world, like negative numbers were an artificial construct. But those peaks and troughs … could she make a tone that produced the <i class="calibre6">opposite pattern</i>? Peaks where there were troughs, troughs where there were peaks?</p>
<p class="fmtx">During her feverish study into sound theory, she discovered the answer to this. A wave could be negated, its opposite created and presented in a way that <i class="calibre6">nullified</i> the original. Canceling it out. They called it destructive interference. Strangely, the theories said that a sound and its opposite <i class="calibre6">sounded exactly the same.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">This stumped her. She played the plates she’d created, indulging in their resonant tones. She put Voidlight spheres into her arm sheath and listened until she could hum that tone. She was delighted when—after hours of concerted practice—she could draw Voidlight out with a touch, like the Fused could do.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Humans <i class="calibre6">could</i> sing the correct tones. Humans <i class="calibre6">could</i> hear the music of Roshar. Her ancestors might have been aliens to this world, but she <i class="calibre6">was</i> its child.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That didn’t solve the question though. If a tone and its destructive interference sounded the same, how could she sing one and not the other?</p>
<p class="fmtx">She played the tone on a plate, humming along. She next played a tuning fork, listened to the tones of the gemstones, then came back to the plate. It was wrong. <i class="calibre6">Barely</i> off. Even though the tones matched.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She asked for, and was given, a file. She tried to measure the notes the plate made, but eventually had to rely on her own ear. She worked on the plate, filing off small sections of the metal and then pulling the bow across it, getting the plate closer and closer.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1041" id="pg_1041" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She could <i class="calibre6">hear</i> the tone she wanted, she thought. Or was it madness? This desire to create an anti-sound?</p>
<p class="fmtx">It took hours. Maybe days. When it finally happened, she knelt bleary-eyed on the stone floor at some unholy hour. Holding a bow, testing her newest version of the plate. When she played this particular tone—bow on steel—something happened. Voidlight was shoved <i class="calibre6">out</i> of the sphere attached to the plate. It was pushed <i class="calibre6">away</i> from the source of the sound.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She tested it again, then a third time to be sure. Though she should have wanted to shout for joy, she simply sat there staring. She ran her hand through her hair, which she hadn’t put up today. Then she laughed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It worked.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">The next day—washed and feeling <i class="calibre6">slightly</i> less insane—Navani incremented. She tested how loud the tone needed to be to produce the desired effect. She measured the tone on different sizes of gemstones and on a stream of Voidlight leaving a sphere to flow toward a tuning fork.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She did all of this in a way that—best she could—hid what she was doing from her watching guard. Hunched over her workspace, she was relatively certain the Regal there wouldn’t be able to tell she’d made a breakthrough. The one last night hadn’t watched keenly; he’d been dozing through much of it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Confident that her tone worked, she began training herself to <i class="calibre6">hum</i> the tone the plate made. It did sound the same, but somehow it <i class="calibre6">wasn’t</i> the same. As when measuring spren—which reacted to your thoughts about them—this tone needed <i class="calibre6">Intent</i> to be created. You had to know what you were trying to do.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Incredibly, it mattered that she <i class="calibre6">wanted</i> to hum the opposite tone to Odium’s song. It sounded crazy, but it worked. It was repeatable and quantifiable. Inside the madness of these last few days, science still worked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She had found Voidlight’s opposite tone. But how could she create Light that expressed this tone? For answers, she looked to nature. A magnet could be made to change its polarity with some captive lightning, and another magnet could realign the pole. But Raboniel had mentioned they could <i class="calibre6">magnetize</i> an ordinary piece of metal that way too.</p>
<p class="fmtx">So were they really changing the polarity of the magnet? Or were they <i class="calibre6">blanking</i> the existing polarity—then rewriting it with something new? The idea intrigued her, and she made a few key requests of her jailers—some objects that would have to be fetched from one of the labs near the top of the tower.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1042" id="pg_1042" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Soon after, Raboniel came to check on her. Navani braced herself. She’d been planning for this.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Navani?” the Fused asked. “This latest request is quite odd. I don’t know what to make of it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s just some esoteric lab equipment,” Navani said from the desk. “Nothing of any real note, though it would be fun to use in some experiments. No bother if you can’t find it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I authorized the request,” Raboniel said. “If it is there, you shall have it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">That was a rhythm to express curiosity. She made a note in her book; she was trying to list them all.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What are you working on?” Raboniel asked. “The guard tells me of a terrible sound you have been making, something discordant.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Damnation. The new tone <i class="calibre6">didn’t</i> sound the same to a Regal. Could she explain it away? “I’m testing how atonal sounds influence Voidlight, if at all.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel lingered, looking over Navani’s shoulder. Then she glanced at the floor, where a bucket of icy water, with snow from outside, held a submerged gemstone. It was an attempt to see if temperature could blank the tone of Voidlight.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What are you not telling me?” Raboniel said to a musing rhythm. “I find your behavior … intriguing.” She glanced to the side as her daughter trailed into the room.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The younger Fused was drooling today. Raboniel had a servant periodically put a cloth against the side of her daughter’s mouth. It wasn’t that her face was paralyzed; more that she didn’t seem to notice or care that she was drooling.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You write about something called ‘axi’ in our notebook,” Navani said, trying to distract Raboniel. “What are these?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“An axon is the smallest division of matter,” Raboniel said. “Odium can see them. Theoretically, with a microscope powerful enough, we could see little balls of matter making up everything.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani had read many theories about such a smallest division of matter. It spoke to her state of mind that she barely considered it a curiosity to have such theories confirmed by a divine source.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Do these axi have a polarity?” Navani asked, as she monitored the temperature of her experiment.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“They must,” Raboniel said. “We theorize that axial interconnection is what holds things together. Certain Surges influence this. The forces between axi are fundamental to the way the cosmere works.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani grunted, writing another notation from the thermometer.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What are you <i class="calibre6">doing</i>?” Raboniel asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1043" id="pg_1043" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Seeing if a colder temperature changes the vibrations in a gemstone,” Navani admitted. “Would you hold this one and tell me if the rhythm changes—or grows louder—as it warms up?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I can do that,” Raboniel said, settling down on the floor beside the desk. Behind, her daughter mimicked her. The attendant—a singer in workform—knelt to dab at the daughter’s lips.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani took the gemstone out with a pair of tongs and gave it to Raboniel. Though Navani could faintly hear the tones of gemstones if she pressed a lot of them to her skin, her skill wasn’t fine-tuned enough to detect small changes in volume. She needed a singer to finish this experiment. But how to keep Raboniel from figuring out what she’d discovered?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel took the sphere and waited, her eyes closed. Finally she shook her head. “I can sense no change in the tone. Why does it matter?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m trying to determine if anything alters the tone,” Navani said. “Creating Warlight requires a slight alteration of Odium’s and Honor’s tones, in order to put them into harmony. If I can find other things that alter Voidlight’s tone, I might be able to create other hybrids.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was a plausible enough explanation. It should explain her requests for plates and other devices, even the ice.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A novel line of reasoning,” Raboniel said to her curiosity rhythm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I had not thought you would take notice,” Navani said. “I assumed you were busy with your … work.” Unmaking the Sibling.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I still need to bring down the final node,” Raboniel said. “Last time I touched the Sibling, I thought I could sense it. Somewhere nearby … but it is very, very small. Smaller than the others…” She rose from the floor. “Let me know if you require further equipment.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Thank you,” Navani said from her desk. Raboniel lingered as Navani recorded her notes about the ice water experiment.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani managed to appear unconcerned right until she heard the plates being shifted. She turned to see Raboniel pulling out the new one, the one she’d hidden beneath several others. Damnation. How had she picked out that one? Perhaps it showed the most use.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel looked to Navani, who forced herself to turn away as if it were nothing. Then Raboniel played it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani breathed out quietly, closing her eyes. She’d racked her mind for ways to hide what she was doing, taking every precaution she could … but she should have known. She was at such a severe disadvantage, watched at all times, with Raboniel always nearby. Navani opened her eyes and found Raboniel staring wide-eyed at the plate. She placed a sphere of Voidlight and played again, watching the Light eject from the sphere.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel spoke to a reverential rhythm. “A tone that <i class="calibre6">forces out</i> Voidlight?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1044" id="pg_1044" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Navani kept her face impassive. Well, that answered one question. She’d wondered if the person playing the note needed the proper Intent to eject the Voidlight, but it seemed that creating the plate to align to her hummed tones was enough.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Navani,” Raboniel said, lowering the bow, “this is remarkable. And <i class="calibre6">dangerous.</i> I felt the Voidlight in my gemheart respond. It wasn’t ejected, but my very <i class="calibre6">soul</i> cringed at the sound. I’m shocked. And … and <i class="calibre6">befuddled.</i> How did you create this?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Math,” Navani admitted. “And inspiration.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This could lead to…” Raboniel hummed to herself, then glanced at the bucket of ice water. “You’re trying to find a way to dampen the vibrations of the Voidlight so you can rewrite it with a different tone. A different polarity. That’s why you asked about axi.” She hummed to an excited rhythm. And Damnation if a part of Navani wasn’t caught up in that sound. In the thrill of discovery. Of being <i class="calibre6">so close.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Careful, Navani,</i> she reminded herself. She had to do her best to keep this knowledge from the enemy. There was a way, a plan she’d been making should Raboniel intrude as she had. A possible path to maintaining the secrets of anti-Voidlight.</p>
<p class="fmtx">For now, she needed to seem amenable. “Yes,” Navani said. “I think what you wanted all along is possible, Raboniel. I have reason to believe there <i class="calibre6">is</i> an opposite Light to Voidlight.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Have you written this down?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No, I’ve merely been toying with random ideas.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A lie you must tell,” Raboniel said. “I do not begrudge you it, Navani. But know that I <i class="calibre6">will</i> rip this room apart to find your notes, if I must.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani remained quiet, meeting Raboniel’s gaze.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Still you do not believe me,” Raboniel said. “That we are so much stronger when working together.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How could I trust your word, Raboniel?” Navani said. “You’ve already broken promises to me, and each time I’ve asked to negotiate for the benefit of my people or the Sibling, you’ve refused.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, but haven’t I led you to a weapon?” she asked. “Haven’t I given you the secrets you needed to make it this far? Within reach of something that could <i class="calibre6">kill a god</i>? All because we worked together. Let’s take this last step as one.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani debated. She knew that Raboniel wasn’t lying; the Fused <i class="calibre6">would</i> rip this room apart to find Navani’s notes. Beyond that, she’d likely take away Navani’s ability to requisition supplies—halting her progress.</p>
<p class="fmtx">And she was <i class="calibre6">so</i> close.</p>
<p class="fmtx">With a sigh, Navani crossed the room and took her notebook—the one they’d named <i class="calibre6">Rhythm of War</i>—from a hidden spot under one of <span aria-label="1045" id="pg_1045" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>the shelves. Perhaps Navani <i class="calibre6">should</i> have kept all of her discoveries in her head, but she’d been unable to resist writing them down. She’d needed to see her ideas on the page, to use notes, to get as far as she had.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel settled in to read, to learn what Navani had discovered about this new tone—humming a rhythm of curiosity to herself. A short time later, a servant arrived at the door carrying a large wooden box.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“At last.” Navani stepped over, taking the box from the servant. Inside was a glass tube a little less than a foot in diameter, though it was several feet long, with thick metal caps on the ends.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And that is?” Raboniel asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A Thaylen vacuum tube,” Navani said. “From the Royal Institute of Barometric Studies. We had this device near the top floor of the tower, where we were doing weather experiments.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She set the device down and took the notebook back from Raboniel, making a few notations to start her next experiment. The metal caps could be unscrewed to reveal chambers that, with the seals in place, wouldn’t disturb the vacuum in the central glass chamber. She opened one end, then affixed an empty diamond into it. Next she used her jeweler’s hammer to crack a gem full of Voidlight—which made it start to leak. She quickly affixed it into the berth on the other side of the vacuum tube. She redid the ends, then used a fabrial pump to remove the air from the side chambers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Finally, she undid the clasps that sealed the side berths, opening them to the central vacuum. If she’d done everything correctly, little to no air would enter the central glass chamber—and she now had a gemstone on either end.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel loomed over Navani as she observed the Voidlight floating out into the vacuum. It didn’t act as air would have—it wasn’t pulled out, for example. Whatever Voidlight was, it didn’t seem to be made up of axi. It was an energy, a power.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What are we doing?” Raboniel asked softly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I believe this is the only way to completely separate Voidlight from the songs of Roshar,” Navani explained. “There can be no sound in a vacuum, as there is no air to transfer the waves. So as this gemstone ejects Voidlight, I’m hoping the Light will not be able to ‘hear’ Odium’s rhythm—for the first time in its existence.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You think it doesn’t emit the rhythm itself,” Raboniel said, “but <i class="calibre6">echoes</i> it. Picks it up.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Like spren pick up mannerisms from humans,” Navani said. “Or how a piece of metal can be magnetized by touching a magnet over a long period of time.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ingenious,” Raboniel whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’ll see,” Navani said. She grabbed her bow, then pressed the plate <span aria-label="1046" id="pg_1046" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>against the side of the vacuum chamber and began playing her anti-Voidlight tone.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel winced at the sound. “The Light won’t be able to hear,” she said. “It’s in a vacuum, as you said.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, but it’s moving across, and will soon touch the empty diamond at the other side,” Navani said. “I want this to be the first thing it hears when it touches matter.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">They had to wait a good while as the Voidlight drifted in the vacuum, but Navani kept playing. In a way, this was the culmination of her days of fervor. The climax to the symphony of madness she’d been composing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Voidlight eventually touched the empty diamond and was pulled inside. She waited until a good measure of it had been drawn in, then had Raboniel undo the clasp separating the diamond’s enclosure from the vacuum. Navani opened this to a little <i class="calibre6">pop</i> of sound, then plucked out the diamond. It glowed faintly violet-black. She stared at it, looking closer, until …</p>
<p class="fmtx">Yes. A faint warping of the air around it. She felt a thrill as she handed it to Raboniel—who screamed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani caught the diamond as Raboniel dropped it. The Fused pulled her hand to her breast, humming violently.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I take it the sound wasn’t pleasant,” Navani said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It was like the tone that plate makes,” Raboniel said, “but a thousand times worse. This is a <i class="calibre6">wrongness.</i> A vibration that <i class="calibre6">should not exist.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It sounds exactly the same as the tone of Odium to me,” Navani said. She set the gemstone on her desk beside the dagger Raboniel had given her. The one that could channel and move Light.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani sat in the chair beside it. Raboniel joined her, moving a stool from beside the wall. Together, both of them stared at the little gemstone that seemed so wrong.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Navani,” Raboniel said. “This … This changes the world.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I know,” Navani said. She rubbed her forehead, sighing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You look exhausted,” Raboniel noted.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ve barely slept for days,” Navani admitted. “Honestly, this is all so overwhelming. I need a break, Raboniel. To walk, to think, to gather my wits and get my blood moving again.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Go ahead,” Raboniel said. “I’ll wait.” She waved for the guard to go with Navani, though the Fused herself continued staring at the gemstone. In fact, Raboniel was so fixated on the diamond that she didn’t notice Navani take <i class="calibre6">Rhythm of War</i> as she stepped out with the guard into the hallway.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She braced herself. Expecting …</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1047" id="pg_1047" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>An explosion.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It shook the corridor, striking with such physical force that Navani’s guard jumped in shock. They both spun around to see smoke spewing from the room they’d left. The guard rushed back—grabbing Navani by the arm and hauling her along.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They found chaos. The desk had exploded, and Raboniel lay on the floor. The Fused’s face was a mask of pain, and her front had been <i class="calibre6">shredded</i>—her havah ripped apart, the carapace scored and broken, the skin at her joints stuck with pieces of glass. Or diamond? She hadn’t taken much shrapnel to the head, fortunately for her, though orange blood seeped from a thousand little wounds on her arms and chest.</p>
<p class="fmtx">At any rate, Raboniel was still alive, and Navani’s scheme had failed. Navani had assumed that, in her absence, Raboniel would take the next step—to try mixing Voidlight with the new Light. Raboniel kept saying she expected the Lights to puff away when mixed, vanishing. She didn’t expect the explosion.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani had hoped that if she died, it would delay Raboniel’s corruption of the tower long enough for Navani to properly weaponize this new Light. That was not to be. The explosion had been smaller than the one that had destroyed the room with the scholars, and Raboniel was far tougher than a human.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A treasonous part of Navani was glad the Fused had not died. Raboniel sat up, then surveyed the room. Several of the bookshelves had collapsed, spilling their contents. Raboniel’s daughter was still sitting where she’d been, as if she hadn’t even noticed what had happened, despite the fact that she bore cuts on her face. Her attendant appeared to be dead, lying slumped on the ground, facedown. Navani felt a spike of legitimate sorrow for that.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What did you do?” Navani said. “Lady of Wishes, what happened?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel blinked as she stood. “I … put the diamond we created into the hilt of the dagger, then used the tip to draw Voidlight from another gemstone, to mix them. It seemed the best way to see if the two Lights would cancel one another out. I thought … I thought the reaction would be calm, like hot and cold water mixing.…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Hot and cold water don’t immediately annihilate one another when they meet,” Navani said. “Besides, heat under pressure—like Light in a gemstone—is another matter.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes,” Raboniel said, blinking several times, seeming dazed. “If you use the lightning of a stormform to ignite something under pressure, it always explodes. Perhaps if Voidlight and anti-Voidlight meet in open air, you’d get no more than a pop. But these were inside a gemstone. I have acted with supreme stupidity.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1048" id="pg_1048" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Other Fused—Deepest Ones—melded in through the walls to see what had happened. Raboniel waved them all off as her cuts healed under the power of her internal Voidlight. The Deepest Ones took the servant, who fortunately stirred as they carried him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The desk was broken, the wall marked by a black scar. Navani smelled smoke—bits of desk still burned. So the explosion had involved heat, not pressure alone. Raboniel shooed away the guard and the other Fused, then picked through the rubble of the desk.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No remnants of the dagger,” Raboniel said. “Another embarrassment I must suffer, losing such a valuable weapon. I have others, but I’ll need to eventually move you out of this room and have it scrubbed for every scrap of raysium. We might be able to melt it down and reforge the dagger.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani nodded.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“For now,” Raboniel said, “I would like you to make me another gemstone filled with that anti-Voidlight.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Now?” Navani asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“If you please.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Don’t you want to change?” Navani asked. “Have someone pick the shards of glass out of your skin…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No,” Raboniel said. “I wish to see this process again. If you please, Navani.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was said to a rhythm that indicated it would happen, regardless of what Navani “pleased.” So she prepared the vacuum chamber—it had been behind Raboniel, sheltered from the brunt of the blast, fortunately. As Navani worked, Raboniel sent someone for another Herald-killing dagger. Why did she need that? Surely they weren’t going to mix the Lights after what had happened.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Feeling an ominous cloud hanging over her, Navani repeated her experiment, this time filling the gemstone a little less—just in case—before removing it and holding it up.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel took it, and though she didn’t drop it this time, she did flinch. “So strange,” she said. She fitted it into her second dagger. Then she undid a screw and slipped out the piece of metal running through the center. She flipped it around—it had points on both ends, and a hole for the screw—before replacing it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“To make the anti-Voidlight flow out of the gemstone along the blade?” Navani asked. “Instead of drawing in what it touches?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Indeed,” Raboniel said. “You may wish to take cover.” Then she turned, walked across the room, and stabbed her daughter in the chest.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani was too stunned to move. She stood there amid the rubble, gaping as Raboniel loomed over the other Fused, pushing the weapon in <span aria-label="1049" id="pg_1049" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>deeper. The younger Fused began to spasm, and Raboniel held her, ruthless as she pressed the weapon into her daughter’s flesh.</p>
<p class="fmtx">There was no explosion. The Voidlight inside the Fused wasn’t under pressure as it was in a gemstone, perhaps. There was a stench of burning flesh, and the skin blistered around the wound. The younger Fused trembled and screamed, clutching at her mother’s arm with a clawed hand.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Then her eyes turned milky, like white marble. She went limp, and Navani thought she saw something escape her lips. Smoke? As if her entire insides had been burned away.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel pulled the dagger out, then tossed it away like a piece of rubbish. She cradled her daughter’s body, pressing her forehead against that of the corpse, holding it close and rocking back and forth.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani walked over, listening to Raboniel’s sorrowful rhythm. Though Raboniel’s topknot of hair spilled around her face, Navani saw tears slipping down her red-and-black cheeks.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani wasn’t certain she’d ever seen a singer cry before. This was not ruthlessness at all. This was something else.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You killed her,” Navani whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel continued to rock the corpse, holding it tighter, shaking as she hummed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Elithanathile,” Navani said, whispering the tenth name of the Almighty. “You killed her forever, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No more rebirth,” Raboniel whispered. “No more Returns. Free at last, my baby. <i class="calibre6">Free.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani pulled her hand up to her chest. That pain … she knew that pain. It was how she’d felt hearing of Elhokar’s death at the hands of the bridgeman traitor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel had done <i class="calibre6">this</i> killing though. Performed it herself! But … had the actual death happened long ago? Centuries ago? What had it been like, living with a child whose body constantly returned to life long after her mind had left her?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This is why,” Navani said, kneeling beside the two. “Your god hinted that anti-Voidlight was possible, and you suspected what it would do. You captured the tower, you imprisoned and pushed me, and possibly delayed the corruption of the Sibling. Because you hoped to find this anti-Voidlight. Not because you wanted a weapon against Odium. Because you wanted to show a mercy to your daughter.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We could never create enough of this anti-Light to threaten Odium,” Raboniel whispered. “That was another lie, Navani. I’m sorry. But you took my dream and you fulfilled it. After I had given up on it, you persisted. <span aria-label="1050" id="pg_1050" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>One might think the immortal being would be the one to continue pursuing an idea to its end, but it was you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani knelt with her hands in her lap, feeling like she’d witnessed something too intimate. So she gave Raboniel time to grieve.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Fused grieved. The immortal destroyers, the mythical enemies of all life, grieved. Raboniel’s grief looked identical to that of a human mother who had lost her child.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eventually, Raboniel rested the body on the ground, then covered up the wound with a cloth from her pocket. She wiped her eyes and stood, calling for the guard to bring her some servants.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What now?” Navani asked her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Now I make sure this death was truly permanent,” Raboniel said, “by communicating with the souls on Braize. If Essu has indeed died a final death, then we’ll know you and I have achieved our goal. And…” She trailed off, then hummed a rhythm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What?” Navani asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Our notebook.” Raboniel looked toward where it sat on the floor. Navani had placed it there while creating the second anti-Voidlight gemstone.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel hummed a different rhythm as servants entered, and she gave terse orders. She sent some to burn her daughter’s corpse and send honors and the ashes to the family that had donated the body to her daughter. She had others gather the vacuum tube and metal plates from Navani’s experiments.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani stepped forward to stop them, but Raboniel prevented her with a calm—but firm—hand. The Fused took the notebook from Navani’s fingers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will have a copy made for you,” she promised Navani. “For now, I need this one to reconstruct your work.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You saw how I did this, Raboniel.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, but I need to create a new plate, a new tone. For Stormlight.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani tried to pull free, but Raboniel’s hold was firm. She hummed a dangerous rhythm, making Navani meet her eyes. Eyes that had been weeping were now firm and unyielding.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So much for your words about working together,” Navani said. “And you <i class="calibre6">dared</i> imply I was wrong to keep trying to hide things from you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I <i class="calibre6">will</i> end the war,” Raboniel said. “That is the promise I will keep, for today we have discovered the means. Finally. A way to make certain that the Radiants can no longer fight. They function as Fused do, you see. If we kill the human, another Radiant will be born. The fight becomes eternal, both sides immortal. Today we end that. I have preserved the <span aria-label="1051" id="pg_1051" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Radiants in the tower for a reason. Anti-Stormlight will need subjects for testing.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You can’t be implying…” Navani said. “You don’t mean…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Today is a momentous day,” Raboniel said, letting go and walking after the servants carrying Navani’s equipment. “Today is the day we discovered a way to destroy Radiant spren. I will let you know the results of the test.”</p>
