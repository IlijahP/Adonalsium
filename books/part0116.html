<p class="lti"><span aria-label="858" id="pg_858" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">There was a time when others would approach me for help with a problem. A time when I was decisive. Capable. Even authoritative.</span></p>
<p class="tni">It was a crystalline day in Shadesmar as Adolin—guarded as always by two honorspren soldiers—climbed to the top of the walls of Lasting Integrity. During his weeks incarcerated in the fortress, he’d discovered that there <i class="calibre6">were</i> weather patterns in Shadesmar. They just weren’t the same type as in the Physical Realm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">When he reached the top of the wall, he could see a faint shimmer in the air. It was only visible if you could look a long distance. A kind of violet-pink haze. Crystalline, they called it. On days like these, plants in Shadesmar grew quickly enough to see the change with your eyes.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Other types of “weather” involved spren feeling invigorated or dreary, or certain types of smaller spren getting more agitated. It was never about temperature or precipitation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">From the top of the wall, he could really get a sense of the fortress’s size. Lasting Integrity was enormous, several hundred feet tall. It was also hollow, and had no roof. Rectangular and resting on the small side, all four of its walls were perfectly sheer, without windows. No human city would ever have been built this way; even Urithiru needed fields at its base and windows to keep the people from going mad.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But Lasting Integrity didn’t follow normal laws of nature. You could walk on the interior walls. Indeed, to reach the top, Adolin had strolled vertically up the inside of the fortress wall. His body thought he had been walking on the ground. However, at the end of the path, he’d reached the <span aria-label="859" id="pg_859" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>battlements. Getting onto them had required stepping off what seemed to be the edge of the ground.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As he’d done so, gravity had caught his foot, then propelled him over so he was now standing at the very top of the fortress. He felt vertigo as he glanced <i class="calibre6">down</i> along a wall he’d recently treated as the ground. In fact, he could see all the way to the floor hundreds of feet below.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Thinking about it gave him a headache. So he looked outward across the landscape. And the view … the view was spectacular. Lasting Integrity overlooked a sea of churning beads lit by the cold sun so they shimmered and sparkled, an entire ocean of captured stars. Huge swells washed through the bay and broke into crashing falls of tumbling beads.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was mesmerizing, made all the more interesting by the lights that congregated and moved in the near distance. Tukar and the people who lived there, reflected in the Cognitive Realm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The other direction had its own less dramatic charms. Rocky obsidian shores gave way to growing forests of glass, lifespren bobbing among the trees. Lifespren were larger here, though still small enough that he wouldn’t have been able to see them save for the bright green glow they gave off.</p>
<p class="fmtx">These lights blinked off and on, a behavior that seemed unique to this region of Shadesmar. Watching, Adolin could swear there was a coordination to their glows. They’d blink in rippling waves, synchronized. As if to a beat.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He took it in for a moment. The view wasn’t why he’d come, however. Not fully. Once he’d spent time drinking in the beauty, he scanned the nearby coast.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Their camp was still there, tucked away a short walk into the highlands, nearer the trees. Godeke, Felt, and Malli waited for the results of his trial. With some persuasion, the honorspren had allowed Godeke to come in, given him a little Stormlight, and let him heal Adolin’s wound. The honorspren had expelled Godeke soon after, but permitted Adolin to communicate with his team via letters.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They’d traded—with his permission—a few of his swords to a passing caravan of Reachers for more food and water. Non-manifested weapons were worth a lot in Shadesmar. The Stump, Zu, and the rest of Adolin’s soldiers had left to bring word to his father. Though Adolin had initially anticipated a quick and dramatic end to his incarceration, the honorspren hadn’t wanted an immediate trial. He should have realized the punctilious spren would want time to prepare.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Though aspects of the delay were frustrating, the wait favored him. The longer he spent among the honorspren, the more chance he had to persuade <span aria-label="860" id="pg_860" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>them. Theoretically. So far, the spren of this fortress seemed about as easy to persuade as rocks.</p>
<p class="fmtx">One other oddity was visible from this high perch. Gathering on the coast nearby was an unusual group of spren. It had begun about two weeks ago as a few scattered individuals, but those numbers grew each day. At this point, there had to be two hundred of them. They stood on the coast all hours of the day, motionless, speechless.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Deadeyes.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Storms,” said Vaiu. “There are so many.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Vaiu was Adolin’s primary jailer for excursions like this. He was a shorter honorspren and wore a full beard, squared like that of an ardent. Unlike many others, Vaiu preferred to go about bare-chested, wearing only an old-style skirt a little like an Alethi takama. With his winged spear, he seemed like a depiction of a Herald from some ancient painting.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What happened to the ones you let in?” Adolin asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We put them with the others,” Vaiu explained. “Everything about them seems normal, for deadeyes. Though we don’t have space left for more. We never expected…” He shook his head. There were no lights of souls near those deadeyes; this wasn’t a gathering of Shardbearers in the Physical Realm. The deadeyes were moving of their own accord, coming up from the depths to stand out here. Silent. Watching.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The fortress had quarters for deadeyes. Though Adolin had little love for these honorspren and their stubbornness, he had to admit there <i class="calibre6">was</i> honor in the way they treated fallen spren. The honorspren had dedicated themselves to finding and caring for as many as they could. Though they’d taken Maya and put her in with the others, they let Adolin visit her each morning to do their exercises together. While they wouldn’t let her wander free, she was treated quite well.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But what would they do with so many? The honorspren had taken in the first group, but as more and more deadeyes arrived, the fortress had reluctantly shut its gates to them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It doesn’t make any sense,” Vaiu said. “They should all be wandering the oceans, not congregating here. What provoked this behavior?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Has anyone tried asking them?” Adolin asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Deadeyes can’t talk.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin leaned forward. Around his hands on the railing, pink crystal fuzz began to grow: the Shadesmar version of moss, spreading because of the crystalline day.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The distance was too great for him to distinguish one scratched-out face from another. However, he did notice when one vanished into mist. Those spren were Shardblades—hundreds of them, more than he’d known existed. When their owners summoned them, their bodies evaporated from <span aria-label="861" id="pg_861" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Shadesmar. Why were they here? Deadeyes usually tried to keep close to their owners, wandering through the ocean of beads.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“There is a Connection happening,” Vaiu said. “Deadeyes cannot think, but they are still spren—bound to the spiritweb of Roshar herself. They can feel what is happening in this keep, that justice will finally be administered.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“If you can call it justice,” Adolin said, “to punish a man for what his ancestors did.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“<i class="calibre6">You</i> are the one who suggested this course, human,” Vaiu said. “You took their sins upon you. This trial cannot possibly make remediation for the thousands murdered, but the deadeyes sense what is happening here.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Adolin glanced at his other guard, Alvettaren. She wore a breastplate and a steel cap—both formed from her substance, of course—above close-cropped hair. As usual she stared forward, her lips closed. She rarely had anything to add.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It is time for today’s legal training,” Vaiu said. “You have very little time until the High Judge returns and your trial begins. You had best spend it studying instead of staring at the deadeyes. Let’s go.”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Veil was really starting to hate this fortress. Lasting Integrity was built like a storming monolith, a stupid brick of a building with <i class="calibre6">no windows.</i> It was impossible to feel anything other than <i class="calibre6">trapped</i> while inside these walls.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But that wasn’t the worst of it. The worst was how honorspren had no respect whatsoever for the laws of nature. Veil opened the door from the small building she shared with Adolin, looking out at what seemed to be an ordinary street. A walkway of worked stone led from her front door and passed by several other small buildings before dead-ending at a wall.</p>
<p class="fmtx">However, as soon as she stepped out, her brain started to panic. Another flat surface of stone hung in the air <i class="calibre6">above</i> her, instead of the sky. It was clustered with its own buildings—and people, mostly honorspren, walked along its pathways. To her left and right were two other surfaces, much the same.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The actual sky was <i class="calibre6">behind</i> her. She was walking on the inside surface of one of the walls of the fortress. It squeezed her mind, making her tremble. <i class="calibre6">Shallan,</i> Veil thought, <i class="calibre6">you should be leading. You’d like the way this place looks.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan did not respond. She huddled deep within, refusing to emerge. Ever since they’d discovered that Pattern had been lying to them, probably for years, she had become increasingly reclusive. Veil was able to coax her out now and then, but lately something … dangerous had come with her. Something they were calling Formless.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="862" id="pg_862" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Veil wasn’t certain it was a new persona. If it wasn’t, would that be even worse?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil let Radiant take over. Radiant wasn’t so bothered by the strange geometry, and she took off down the path without feeling vertigo—though even she had trouble sometimes. The worst parts were the strange halfway zones at the corners where each plane met, where you had to step from one wall to another. The honorspren did it easily, but Radiant’s stomach did somersaults every time she had to.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Shallan,</i> Radiant thought, <i class="calibre6">you should sketch this place. We should carry drawings with us when we leave.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Nothing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Honorspren liked to keep the hour exactly, so the bells told Radiant she was on time as she turned up the side of the wall toward the sky, passing various groups of spren going about their business. This wall of the fortress—the southern plane—was the most beautified, with gardens of crystalline plants of a hundred different varieties.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Fountains somehow flowed here, the only free water Radiant had seen in Shadesmar. She passed one fountain that surged and fell in powerful spouts; if a spray got beyond about fifteen feet high, the water would suddenly break off the top and stream down toward the <i class="calibre6">actual</i> ground rather than back toward the wall plane. Storms, this place didn’t make any kind of sense.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant turned away from the fountain and tried to focus on the people she was passing. She hadn’t expected to find anyone other than honorspren in here, considering how strict the fortress was, but apparently its xenophobic policy had only been instituted a year ago. Any other people then living inside the fortress were allowed to stay, though they’d be forbidden reentry if they left.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That meant ambassadorial delegations from the other spren nations—as well as some tradespeople and random wanderers—had been grandfathered into the honorspren lockdown. Most importantly, seventeen humans lived here.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Without direction from Shallan, and with the honorspren taking their time preparing their trial, Radiant and Veil had reached a compromise. They’d find Restares, the person Mraize had sent them to locate. They wouldn’t take any actions against him unless they could get Shallan to decide, but Radiant was perfectly willing to locate him. This man, the phantom leader of the Sons of Honor, was a key part of this entire puzzle—and she was intensely curious why Mraize wanted him so badly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Restares was, according to Mraize, a human male. Radiant carried a description of the man in her pocket, though none of the honorspren Veil had asked knew the name. And unfortunately, the description was rather <span aria-label="863" id="pg_863" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>vague. A shorter human with thinning hair. Mraize said Restares was a secretive type, and would likely be using an alias and perhaps a disguise.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He was supposedly paranoid, which made perfect sense to Radiant. Restares led a group of people who had worked to restore the singers and the Fused. The coming of the Everstorm had led to the fall of multiple kingdoms, the deaths of thousands, and the enslavement of millions. The Sons of Honor were deplorable for seeking these things. True, it wasn’t clear their efforts had in fact influenced the Return, but she could understand why they wanted to hide.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Upon first entering the fortress, she’d asked to be introduced to the other humans residing in the place. In response, the honorspren had given her the full list of all humans living here. With limited locations to search, she’d assumed her task would be easy. Indeed, it had started out that way. She’d started with the largest group of people: a caravan of traders from a kingdom called Nalthis, a place out in the darkness beyond the edges of the map. Veil had chatted with them at length, discovering that Azure—who had moved on from the fortress by now—was from the same land.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant had trouble conceptualizing what it meant for there to be kingdoms out away from the continent. Did Azure’s people live on islands in the ocean?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No,</i> Veil thought. <i class="calibre6">We’re avoiding the truth, Radiant. It means something else. Like Mraize told us. Those people came from another land. Another world.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant’s mind reeled at the thought. She took a deep breath, slowing near a group of trees—real ones from the Physical Realm, kept alive with Stormlight instead of sunlight—that were the centerpieces of this park. The tops were so high that when leaves fell off, they drifted down toward the real ground, through the middle of the fortress.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Shallan,</i> Radiant thought. <i class="calibre6">You could come and talk to people from other worlds. This is too big for Veil and me.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan stirred, but as she did, that darkness moved with her. She quickly retreated.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Let’s focus on today’s mission, Radiant,</i> Veil said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant agreed, and forced Veil to emerge. She could handle the strange geography; she had to. She put her head down and continued. None of the travelers from Nalthis looked like Restares, or seemed likely to be him in disguise. The next handful on her list had been Horneaters; apparently there was a clan of them who lived in Shadesmar. She’d doubted any were Restares, but she’d interviewed each of them just in case.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That done, Veil had been left with five people. Four turned out to be wanderers. None had been open about their pasts, but over the weeks she’d met with them one by one. After conversing with each, she had reported on them to Mraize. He had eliminated each of those as possibilities.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="864" id="pg_864" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Now, only a single name remained on her list. This person was the most reclusive of them all—but was male, and the descriptions of him from the honorspren indicated that he was probably her quarry. Today she would finally catch a glimpse of him. With the subject confirmed she could call Mraize, find out what message she was supposed to deliver to Restares, then be done with this mission.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The target called himself “Sixteen.” He supposedly came out of his home once every sixteen days exactly—the regularity of it amused the honorspren, who suffered the odd fellow because of the novelty. No one knew how he survived without food, and no one reported a terrible stench or anything like that from him—though he didn’t ever seem to bathe or empty a chamber pot. Indeed, the more she’d learned about him, the more Veil was certain this mysterious man was her target.</p>
<p class="fmtx">His home was a small box built near the statue garden. Veil had made a habit of visiting this garden, where she tried to coax Shallan out by drawing. It worked occasionally, though Shallan usually retreated after a half hour or so of sketching.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Today, Veil curled up on a bench with a sketchpad, coat enveloping her, hat shading her eyes. Today was the day that Sixteen would emerge, assuming he followed his pattern. All she had to do was wait and not act suspicious.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Shallan,</i> Veil said, opening the sketchbook. <i class="calibre6">See? It’s time to draw.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan started to emerge. Unfortunately, a faint humming sound made her panic and Veil was thrust back into control. She sighed, glancing to the side—to where Pattern walked among the statues, which she’d been told were of honorspren killed in the Recreance. Tall men and women with heroic builds and clothing that—though made of stone—seemed to ripple in the wind. How odd that they’d made these; after all, the real individuals were still around, though deadeyed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Pattern bobbed over to her. He was easy to tell from other Cryptics; he had an excitable spring to his step, while others slunk or crept, more furtive.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I thought you were watching the Nalthians today,” Veil said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I was!” he said, plopping down on the bench beside her. “But Veil, I do not think any of them are Restares. They do not look like him at all. They do not even look like people from Roshar. Why do you think Azure appeared so much like an Alethi, when these have the wrong features?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Don’t know,” Veil said, pretending to sketch. “But this Restares could be using something like Lightweaving. I need you to watch them carefully.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I am sorry,” Pattern said, his pattern slowing, like a wilting plant. “I miss being with you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="865" id="pg_865" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">You’re worried you’ll miss something important, traitor,</i> Shallan thought. <i class="calibre6">And want an excuse to keep spying on me.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil sighed again. She reached over and put her hand on Pattern’s. He hummed softly.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We need to confront him,</i> Radiant thought. <i class="calibre6">We need to find out exactly why he is lying.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil wasn’t so certain. It was all growing so messy. Pattern, Shallan’s past, the mission they were on. She needed Shallan to remember. That would solve so much.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Wait,</i> Radiant thought. <i class="calibre6">Veil, what do you know? What do you remember that I do not?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Veil?” Pattern asked. “Can I talk to Shallan?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I can’t force her to emerge, Pattern,” Veil said. Stormwinds; she suddenly felt so tired. “We can try later, if you want. For now, Sixteen is going to come out of that house in a few minutes. I need to be ready to intercept him in a way that reveals his face, but doesn’t make him suspicious of me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Pattern hummed. “Do you remember,” he said softly, “when we first met on the boat? With Jasnah? Mmm … You jumped in the water. She was so shocked.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Nothing shocks Jasnah.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That did. I barely remember—I was so new to your realm.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That wasn’t the first time we met though,” Radiant said, sitting up straighter. “Shallan had spoken oaths before, after all. She had a Shardblade.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes.” If he had been human, his posture would have been described as unnaturally still. Hands clasped, seated primly. His pattern moved, expanding, contracting, rotating upon itself. Like an explosion.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I think,” he finally said, “we have been doing this wrong, Radiant. I once tried to help Shallan remember, and that was painful for her. Too painful. So I started to think it was good for her not to remember. And the lies <i class="calibre6">were</i> delicious. Nothing is better than a lie with so much truth.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The holes in her past,” Radiant said. “Shallan doesn’t want to remember them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“She can’t. At least not yet.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“When Shallan summoned you as a Blade,” Radiant said, “and killed her mother, were you surprised? Did you know she was going to do something that drastic?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I … don’t remember,” Pattern said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How can you not remember?” Radiant pressed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He remained quiet. Radiant frowned, considering the lies she’d caught him in during the last few weeks.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Why did you want to bond a human, Pattern?” Radiant found herself <span aria-label="866" id="pg_866" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>asking. “In the past, you’ve seemed so certain that Shallan would kill you. Yet you bonded her anyway. Why?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">This is a dangerous line of questioning, Radiant,</i> Veil warned. <i class="calibre6">Be careful.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“Mmm…” Pattern said, humming to himself. “Why. So many answers to a why. You want the truest one, but any such truth is also a lie, as it pretends to be the only answer.” He tipped his head to the right, looking toward the sky—though so far as she knew, he didn’t “see” forward, as he didn’t have eyes. He seemed to sense all around him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She glanced in the same direction. Colors shimmered in the sky. It was a crystalline day.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You and the others,” Pattern said, “refer to Shadesmar as the world of the spren, and the Physical Realm as ‘your’ world. Or the ‘real’ world. That is not true. We are not two worlds, but one. And we are not two peoples, but one. Humans. Spren. Two halves. Neither complete.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I wanted to be in the other realm. See that part of our world. And I knew danger was coming. All spren could sense it. The Oathpact was no longer working correctly. Voidspren were sneaking onto Roshar, using some kind of back door. Two halves cannot fight this enemy. We need to be whole.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And if Shallan killed you?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Mmm. I was sure you would. But together, we Cryptics thought we needed to try. And I volunteered. I thought, maybe even if I die it will be the step other spren need. You cannot reach the end of a proof without many steps in the middle, Shallan. I was to be the middle step.” He turned toward her. “I no longer believe you will kill me. Or perhaps I wish to no longer believe you will kill me. Ha ha.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant wanted to believe. She wanted to know.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">This will lead to pain,</i> Veil warned.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Can I trust you, Pattern?” Radiant asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Any answer will be a lie,” he said. “I cannot see the future like our friend Renarin. Ha ha.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Pattern, have you lied to us?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">His pattern wilted. “… Yes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant took a deep breath. “And have you been spying on us? Have you been using the cube Mraize gave us, in secret?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m sorry, Radiant,” he said softly. “I couldn’t think of another way.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Please answer the questions.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have,” he said, his pattern growing even smaller.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">There,</i> Radiant thought. <i class="calibre6">Was that so hard? We should have asked him right away, Veil.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">It was only then that she noticed, deep inside, that Shallan was seething. Twisting about herself, trembling, fuming, alternating between terror and anger.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="867" id="pg_867" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>That … didn’t seem good.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Pattern’s pattern swirled small and tight. “I try to be worthy of trust. That is not a lie. But I have brought someone for Shallan to meet. I think it is important.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He stood with a smooth inhuman motion, then gestured behind him with one long-fingered hand. Radiant frowned and glanced over her shoulder. Leaves from the trees farther up the plane lazily drifted down the central corridor. A faint shimmer dusted the air, and a small crystal tree started to grow in miniature on the bench beside her hand.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Standing near a statue behind them was a dark figure wearing a stiff robe. Like Pattern’s, but dustier. And a head trapped in shadow. Twisted and wrong.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Damnation,</i> Veil thought.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan emerged. She grabbed Radiant, shoved her away someplace dark and small, and slammed the door shut.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Shallan …</i> Veil thought, then her voice crumpled. She should remain sectioned away. In the past, they hadn’t talked to one another this way. They’d simply taken turns being in control, as they were needed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan was in control. The other two became whispers. “No,” she said to Pattern. “We are not doing this.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“But—” he said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“<i class="calibre6">NO,</i>” she said. “I want <i class="calibre6">nothing</i> from you, Pattern. You are a traitor and a liar. You have betrayed my trust.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He wilted, flopping onto the bench. Shallan saw movement from the corner of her eye and spun, her heart thundering in her ears. The small building she’d come here to watch—Sixteen’s home—had opened, and a furtive figure had emerged. Hunched over, face hidden in the cowl of a cloak, the figure hurried through the statue park.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Excellent. It was time to fulfill Mraize’s mission.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Shallan …</i> Veil whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She ignored the voice and settled down on the bench, acting nonchalant as she opened her notebook. Veil’s plan had included wandering through the statue park, idly flipping through her notebook, then bumping into Sixteen—hopefully getting a good look at his face.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Unfortunately, Shallan wasn’t in position yet to do that. She’d been distracted by Pattern and his lies. She stood and meandered toward the statue garden, trying to appear nonthreatening. She needed to determine for certain that Sixteen was her target. Then …</p>
<p class="fmtx">Then what.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kill him.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">What are you doing?</i> Veil thought. Such a distant, annoying voice. Couldn’t she quiet it entirely?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="868" id="pg_868" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">You were the one who wanted to go forward with Mraize’s plan,</i> Shallan thought. <i class="calibre6">Well, I agree. So two of us have decided.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I wanted to gather information,</i> Veil thought. <i class="calibre6">I wanted to use it against him. Why are you suddenly so aggressive?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Because this was exactly who Shallan was. Who she’d always been. She stalked toward the statue garden. Radiant was, of course, screaming and railing at her—but she was outvoted.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan had been watching and learning these last months, and she’d picked up some things from Veil. She knew to get into Sixteen’s blind spot, then stop and appear like she was sketching a statue—so when he turned to glance around, she seemed unremarkable.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She knew to glide forward when he turned away. She knew to step carefully, putting the heel of her foot down first and rolling toward the toe. She knew to walk on the sides of her feet as much as possible, not letting the flats slap.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She got right up behind Sixteen as he hunched over, fiddling with some notes. She grabbed him by the shoulder, then spun him around. His hood fell, revealing his face.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He was Shin; there was no mistaking that pale, almost sickly skin and those childlike eyes. Restares was a short Alethi man with wispy hair. This man was short, yes, but completely bald, and was not Alethi. So unless Mraize was wrong and Restares was a Lightweaver, this was not her man.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He shouted and said something to her in a language she didn’t recognize. She released him, and he fled toward his home. Her heart thumping in her chest, she pulled her hand out of the satchel. She hadn’t even realized she’d reached into that, for a weapon.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She didn’t need it. This wasn’t him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Pattern walked up, having recovered some of his characteristic perkiness. There was no sign of the other spren he’d wanted her to meet.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Well!” he said. “That was exciting. But this is not him, is it?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No,” Shallan said. “It’s not.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Shallan, I need to explain to you. What I’ve been doing.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No,” Shallan said, covering her pain. “It is done. Let’s move forward instead.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Mmm…” Pattern said. “I … What has happened to you? Something has changed. Are you … Veil?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No,” Shallan said. “I’m me. And I’ve finally made a difficult decision that was a long time coming. Come on, we need to report to Mraize. His intel was wrong—Restares is not in this fortress.”</p>
