<p class="lti"><span aria-label="951" id="pg_951" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">Why would I</span> <span class="esans_caslonantique_medium_">want</span> <span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">to remember?</span></p>
<p class="tni">Dabbid had been different all his life.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That was the word his mother had used. “Different.” He liked that word. It didn’t try to pretend. Something <i class="calibre6">was</i> different about him. He had been six when he started talking. He still couldn’t do adding in his head. He could follow instructions, but he forgot steps if they were too long.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He was different.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The surgeons hadn’t been able to say the reason. They said some people are just different. He was always going to be like this. The midwife, when she heard about him later, said the cord was wrapped around his neck when he was born. Maybe that was why.</p>
<p class="fmtx">When he’d been young, Dabbid had tried putting a rope around his neck to see how it felt. He hadn’t jumped off a ledge. He hadn’t tied the other end to anything. He hadn’t tried to die. He’d just tightened it a little, so he could know what baby Dabbid had felt.</p>
<p class="fmtx">When someone saw, everyone had panicked. They called him stupid. They took ropes away from him for years. They thought he was too dumb to know it would hurt him. He often got into trouble like that. Doing things others wouldn’t do. Not understanding it would make people panic. He had to be very careful not to make regular people frightened. They liked to be scared of him. He did not know why. He was different. But not scary different.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It had gotten worse when his mother died. People had become meaner on that day. It wasn’t his fault. He hadn’t even been there. But suddenly, <span aria-label="952" id="pg_952" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>everyone was meaner. He ended up at war, serving a lighteyes. Washing his clothing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">When a darkeyed baby was born to the man’s wife, everyone had gotten angry at Dabbid. He’d explained that they were wrong. Everybody was wrong sometimes.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It hadn’t been until much later that he’d realized the brightlady had lied. To punish someone other than her secret lover. He <i class="calibre6">could</i> understand things, if he had time to think about them. Sometimes.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He’d ended up running bridges. Dabbid didn’t remember much from that time. He’d lost track of the days. He’d barely spoken back then. He had been confused. He had been frightened. He had been angry. But he didn’t let people know he was angry. People got scared and hurt him when he was angry.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He’d done his job, terrified more each day, certain he would die. In fact, he’d figured he must already be dead. So when a horse—from one of Sadeas’s own soldiers—had all but trampled him, shoving him and hurling him to the ground, his arm broken, he’d curled up and waited to die.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Then … Kaladin. Kaladin Stormblessed. He hadn’t cared that Dabbid was different. He hadn’t cared that Dabbid had given up. Kaladin hauled him out of Damnation and gave him another family.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid couldn’t quite recall when he’d started to come out of his battle shock. He hadn’t ever <i class="calibre6">really</i> lost it. Who could? People clapping sounded like bowstrings snapping. Footfalls sounded like hooves. Or he’d hear singing, like the Parshendi, and he was there again. Dying.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Still, he had started to feel better. Somewhere along the way, he’d started to feel like his old self. Except he’d had a new family. He’d had <i class="calibre6">friends.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">And none of them had known he was different.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Well, they thought he was another kind of different. They thought he had been hurt by the battle, like all of them. He was <i class="calibre6">one</i> of them. They hadn’t known about his mind. How he’d been born.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He didn’t like it when people used the word “stupid” for the way he was. People called one another stupid when they made mistakes. Dabbid wasn’t a mistake. He could <i class="calibre6">make</i> mistakes. Then he was stupid. But not always. He couldn’t think fast like others. But that made him different, not stupid. Stupid was a choice.</p>
<p class="fmtx">In the past, his speech had told people he was different. He’d figured that out when he was moving from job to job after his mother died. When he’d spoken, they’d known. So … with Bridge Four … he’d just kept on not speaking.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That way they wouldn’t know. That way they wouldn’t realize he was Dabbid different. He could just be Bridge Four different.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Then everyone had started getting spren. Except him. And then the tower had started talking to him. And … he still wasn’t certain if he’d <span aria-label="953" id="pg_953" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>done something stupid or not. But going to Rlain, that <i class="calibre6">hadn’t</i> been stupid. He was certain of it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">So today, he tried not to think about his mistakes. He tried not to think about how if he’d been stronger, he could have helped Kaladin fight. He tried not to think about how he’d lied to the others by pretending he couldn’t speak. He tried to focus on what he could do to help.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He led Rlain up through the tunnels. They met singers a couple of times. Rlain talked, his voice calm with rhythms, and the singers let them go. They went up and up, and Dabbid showed him a hidden stairwell. They snuck past the guard patrols on the sixth floor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Up and up. Dabbid’s heart thumped. Worrying. Would Lift meet them, like she’d promised? Lift knew the tower better than they did. She said she could make it on her own. But would she run away?</p>
<p class="fmtx">When they reached the meeting place on the tenth floor, they found her waiting. She sat on the ground, eating some curry and bread.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Where did you get <i class="calibre6">that</i>?” Rlain asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Fused,” she said, gesturing. “Funny. They need to eat. Suppose that means they poop, right?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I suppose,” Rlain said, sounding disapproving.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ain’t that a kick in the bits?” Lift asked. “You get made immortal; you can live through the centuries. You can fly, or walk through rock, or something like that. But you still gotta piss like everyone else.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t see the point of this conversation,” Rlain said. “Hurry. We need to get to Kaladin.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lift rolled her eyes in an exaggerated way, then stood up and handed Dabbid some flatbread. He nodded in thanks and tucked it away for later.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“When didya start talkin’?” Lift asked him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I was six,” he said. “Mom said.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No, I mean…” She gestured at him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid felt himself blush, and he looked at his feet. “I could for a long time. Just didn’t.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Didn’t want to talk? I’ve <i class="calibre6">never</i> felt like that. Except this once, when I ate the queen’s dinner, but it had been sitting <i class="calibre6">out,</i> see, and she didn’t put it away like she should have. It’s her fault, I told her, because it’s like leavin’ a sword out where a baby could step on it and cut up her foot or somethin’.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Can we please keep moving?” Rlain demanded.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid led them the rest of the way. He felt more anxious now. Was he too late? Had Kaladin died while he was gone? Was he too slow to help? Too different to have realized earlier what he should have done?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid led them to the place on the eleventh floor, but the door had stopped working. It had been too long since Kaladin infused it. They <span aria-label="954" id="pg_954" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>had Lift though, and when she pressed her hand to the gemstone, the door opened.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It smelled of sweat and blood in there. Dabbid hurried past the place where Teft lay unconscious, reaching Kaladin. On the floor, wrapped in blankets. Thrashing. Still alive.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Still alive.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Storms,” Lift said, stepping over. Kaladin’s face was coated in sweat. His teeth were gritted, his eyes squeezed shut. He flailed in his blankets, growling softly. Dabbid had cut off his shirt to look for wounds. While there were scabs all along Kaladin’s side, the worst part was the infection. It spread across the skin from the cut. A violent redness. Hateful, covered in little rotspren.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lift stepped back, wrapping her arms around herself. “Storms.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ve … never seen a fever like that,” Rlain said, towering over the two of them. Did he know how large he was in warform? “Have you?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lift shook her head.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Please,” Dabbid said. “Please help.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lift held out her hand, palm forward, and burst alight with power. Stormlight rose from her skin like white smoke, and she knelt. She shied away as Kaladin thrashed again, then she lunged forward and pressed her hand to his chest.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The redness immediately retreated, and the rotspren fled, as if they couldn’t stand the presence of her touch. Kaladin’s back arched. He was hurting!</p>
<p class="fmtx">Then he collapsed into the blankets. Lift pressed her other hand against his side, and the wound continued to heal, the redness fleeing. She furrowed her brow and bit her lip. Dabbid did the same. Maybe it would help.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She pushed so much Stormlight into Kaladin he started glowing himself. When she sat back, the scabs flaked off his side, leaving smooth new skin.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That … was hard,” she whispered. “Even harder than when I saved Gawx.” She wiped her brow. “I’m sweating.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Thank you,” Dabbid said, taking her hand.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ew,” she said. Oh. It was the hand she’d just used to wipe her head.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“<i class="calibre6">Thank you,</i>” he said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She shrugged. “My awesomeness—the slippery part—doesn’t work anymore. But this does. Wonder why.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain went to close the door. Dabbid tried to make Kaladin comfortable, bunching up a blanket to make a pillow. His friend was still unconscious, but sleeping peacefully now.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have a lot of questions, Dabbid,” Rlain said. “First off, why have you been keeping quiet when you could speak?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="955" id="pg_955" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He don’t gotta say nothin’ if he don’t wanna,” Lift said. She’d found their rations already, and was eating. Wow.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He’s Bridge Four,” Rlain said. “We’re family. Family doesn’t lie to one another.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m sorry,” Dabbid said softly. “I just … didn’t want you to know I’m … different.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’re all different,” Rlain said, folding his arms. Storms, he was so frightening in carapace armor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m more different,” Dabbid said. “I … I was born different.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You mean born … you know … an idiot?” Rlain said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid winced. He hated that word, though Rlain didn’t use it hatefully. It was just a word to him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Touched,” Lift said. “I’ve known lotsa kids like him on the street. They don’t think the same way as everyone else. It happens.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It happens,” Dabbid agreed. “It happened to me. But you didn’t know. So you couldn’t treat me like I was … wrong. You know about being extra different, right Rlain?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I guess I do,” he said. “You shouldn’t feel that you have to hide what you are though.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will be fixed,” Dabbid said, “when I get a spren. Becoming Radiant will heal me, because my brain isn’t supposed to be like this. I was hurt after I was born. The tower said so.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The tower?” Rlain asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The tower can talk,” Lift said. “It’s a spren.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And it promised to heal you, Dabbid?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He nodded. Though it hadn’t said that in so many words. He wondered now if it had been lying.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The queen hadn’t been pleased by how he’d snuck around, doing tasks for the Sibling. Maybe he should be more suspicious. Even of spren.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But someday … when he was Radiant …</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain dug out a new set of blankets for Kaladin from the pile. Dabbid had washed those earlier, as he’d wanted something to do. They got Kaladin untangled from the sweaty ones, then wrapped him in—</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What in storming Damnation are you fools doing?” a gruff voice said from behind them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid froze. Then turned around slowly. Lift was perched on the end of Teft’s shelf, absently munching on a ration bar—Soulcast grain, cooked and pressed. She was pulling her hand back from Teft’s exposed foot, Stormlight curling off her body.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Teft, in turn, was pushing himself up to sit.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Teft was <i class="calibre6">awake.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="956" id="pg_956" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Dabbid let out a whoop and leaped up. Rlain just started humming like he did sometimes.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What?” Lift said. “Wasn’t I supposed to heal the stinky one too?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Stinky?” Teft said, looking under his blanket. “Where in Damnation are my clothes? What happened to me? We were at the tavern, right? Storms, my <i class="calibre6">head.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You can wake the Radiants?” Rlain asked, rushing over and seizing Lift by the arms. “Why didn’t you say something?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Huh?” she said. “Look, shellhead, I’ve been in a stormin’ <i class="calibre6">cage.</i> My spren vanished, said he was going to try to get help, and I ain’t heard from him since. Bet he joined the Voidbringers, storming traitor. I don’t know what’s been goin’ on in the tower. What’s wrong with the others?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“In a cage?” Teft said. “Why? And where are my <i class="calibre6">storming</i> clothes?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“There’s a lot to explain, Teft,” Rlain said. “The tower is occupied by the enemy and…” He stopped, then frowned, glancing toward Kaladin.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin … Kaladin was <i class="calibre6">stirring.</i> They all hushed. Even Teft. Kaladin blinked and <i class="calibre6">opened his eyes.</i> He grew tense, then saw Rlain and Dabbid and relaxed, taking a deep breath.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Is this a dream?” he whispered. “Or am I finally awake?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re awake, Kal,” Rlain said, kneeling to take Kaladin by the shoulder. “Thank the purest tones. You’re awake. It worked.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid stepped back as Teft said something, causing Kaladin to sit up—then laugh in joy. It had worked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid wasn’t Radiant. He wasn’t brave. He wasn’t smart. But today he hadn’t been stupid either.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Once, Kaladin had pulled Dabbid out of Damnation itself. It felt good to return that act of heroism with a small one of his own.</p>
