<p class="tni">Kaladin clung to Teft’s limp form and felt it all crumbling. The flimsy facade of confidence he had built to let himself fight. The way he pretended he was fine.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl landed on his shoulder, arms wrapped around herself, and said nothing. What was there to say?</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was over.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was all just … over. What was there to life if he couldn’t protect the people he loved?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Long ago, he’d promised himself he’d try one last time. He’d try to save the men of Bridge Four. And he’d failed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Teft had been so vibrant, so alive. So sturdy and so constant. He’d finally defeated his own monsters, had really come into his own, claiming his Radiance. He had been a wonderful, loving, <i class="calibre6">amazing</i> man.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He’d depended on Kaladin. Like Tien. Like a hundred others. But he couldn’t save them. He <i class="calibre6">couldn’t</i> protect them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl whimpered, shrinking in on herself. Kaladin wished he could shrink as well. Maybe if he’d lived as his father wanted, he could have avoided this. He said he fought to protect, but he didn’t end up protecting anything, did he? He just destroyed. Killed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin Stormblessed wasn’t dead. He’d never existed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin Stormblessed was a lie. He always had been.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The numbness claimed him. That hollow darkness that was so much <span aria-label="1125" id="pg_1125" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>worse than pain. He couldn’t think. Didn’t want to think. Didn’t want anything.</p>
<p class="fmtx">This time, Adolin wasn’t there to pull him out of it. To force him to keep walking. This time, Kaladin was given exactly what he deserved.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Nothing. And nothingness.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Navani froze in place. Raboniel—suddenly struck with incredible pain from Navani’s trap—collapsed, dropping the dagger. Steeling herself, Navani went down on her hands and knees, then lunged forward to grab it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The pain was excruciating. But Navani had tested these devices upon herself, and she knew what they did. She lost control of her legs, but managed to crawl forward and plunge the dagger into Raboniel’s chest. She kept her weight on the weapon, pressing it down, smelling burned flesh.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel screamed, writhing, clawing at Navani. The painrial did its job however, and prevented her from fighting back effectively.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m sorry,” Navani said through gritted teeth. “I’m … sorry. But next time … try … not … to be … <i class="calibre6">so trusting.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The painrial soon ran out. Navani had set it up days ago, with a small Voidlight gemstone for power. It hadn’t been intended to work for very long. She was pleased by the range though. She’d specifically worked on that feature.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani sat up, then wrapped her arms around herself, trying to fight off the phantom effects of the pain. Finally she looked toward Raboniel’s corpse.</p>
<p class="fmtx">And found the Fused’s eyes quivering, not glassy and white like her daughter’s had been. Navani scrambled away.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel moved her arms limply, then turned her head toward Navani.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How?” Navani demanded. “Why are you alive?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not … enough … Light…” Raboniel croaked. She gripped the knife in her chest and pulled it free, letting out a sigh. “It hurts. I’m … I’m … not…” She closed her eyes, though she continued to breathe.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani inched forward, wary.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You must take … the notebook…” Raboniel said. “And you must … run. Vyre … returns.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You tell me to run, after I tried to kill you?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not … tried…” Raboniel said. “I … cannot hear rhythms.… My soul … dying…” She pried open her eyes and fixed them on Navani. “You … tricked me well, Navani. Clever, clever. Well … done.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1126" id="pg_1126" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“How can you say that?” Navani said, glancing toward the desk and the papers on it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Live … as long as I … and you can appreciate … anything … that still surprises you.… Go, Navani. Run … The war must … end.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani felt sick, now that she’d gone through with it. An unexpected pain pricked her at the betrayal. Nevertheless, she moved to the desk and picked up the notebook.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I need to get this out of the tower,</i> she realized. <i class="calibre6">It is perhaps even more important than the Sibling. A way to kill Fused permanently. A way to …</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">To end the war. If both Radiant spren and Fused could die for good, it <i class="calibre6">could</i> stop, couldn’t it?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Stormfather,” she whispered. “That’s what it was all about.” Raboniel wanted to end the war, one way or another. The notebook Navani held was a copy, and Navani realized that the original notebook would be in Kholinar, delivered to the leaders of the singer military—likely along with the vacuum chamber and the metal plates.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani walked over to Raboniel. “You wanted a way to end it,” she said. “You don’t care who wins.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I care,” Raboniel whispered. “I want … the singers to win. But your side … winning … is better than … than…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Than the war continuing forever,” Navani said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Raboniel nodded, her eyes closed. “Go. Run. Vyre will—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani looked up as a blur flashed in the hallway, reflecting light. A <i class="calibre6">thump</i> hit her chest, and she grunted at the impact, stunned—briefly—before pain began to wash through her body. Sharp and alarming.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">A knife,</i> she thought, befuddled to see the hilt of a throwing knife sticking from the side of her torso, next to her right breast. When she took a breath, the pain sharpened with a sudden spike.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She looked up, pressing her hand to the wound, feeling warm blood spill out. At the far end of the hallway, a figure in a black uniform walked slowly forward. A Shardblade appeared in his hand. The assassin’s Blade.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Moash had returned.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Highmarshal Kaladin was dead.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Venli watched the human, so consumed by his grief that he knelt there, motionless, for minutes on end. And they all watched. Silent Heavenly Ones. Solemn guards. Disbelieving humans. No one seemed to want to speak, or even breathe.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That was how Venli should have felt upon losing her sister. Why didn’t she have the emotions of a normal person? She’d been sad, but she <span aria-label="1127" id="pg_1127" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>didn’t think she’d <i class="calibre6">ever</i> been so overcome by grief that she acted like Stormblessed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Timbre pulsed comfortingly inside her. Everyone was different. And Venli <i class="calibre6">was</i> on the right path.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Except … there wasn’t really a point in returning to help now, was there? It was over. Beside her, Leshwi descended until her feet touched the ground, then she bowed her head.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Show her,</i> Timbre pulsed. <i class="calibre6">What you are.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“What? Now?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Show her.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Reveal what she was, in front of everyone? Venli shrank at the thought, attuning the Terrors.</p>
<p class="fmtx">One by one the other Heavenly Ones touched down, as if in respect. For an enemy.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This is stupidity,” the Pursuer said, shoving Lirin into Leshwi’s hands. “I can’t believe we’re all just standing here.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Leshwi looked up from her vigil, humming to Spite. Then, amazingly, she pulled out a knife and cut Lirin’s hands free.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have not forgotten how you tried to turn the Nine against me,” the Pursuer said, pointing at Leshwi. “You seek to destroy my legacy.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your legacy is dead, Defeated One,” Leshwi said. “It died when you ran from him.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My legacy is untouched!” the Pursuer roared, causing Venli to stumble back, afraid. “And this is complete madness! I will prove myself and continue my tradition!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No!” Leshwi said, passing the still-gagged human to one of the other Heavenly Ones. She grabbed the Pursuer, but he left a husk in her hand, exploding out as a ribbon of light to cross the atrium floor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No…” Venli whispered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Pursuer appeared above Stormblessed. The Fused yanked a sharpened carapace spur off his arm, then—holding it like a dagger—he grabbed the kneeling man by one shoulder.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin Stormblessed looked up and let loose a howl that seemed to vibrate with a hundred discordant rhythms. Venli attuned the Lost in return.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Pursuer stabbed, but Stormblessed grabbed his arm and turned, becoming a blur of motion. He somehow twisted around so he was behind the Pursuer, then found a knife somewhere on his person—moving with such speed that Venli had trouble tracking him. Stormblessed slammed the knife at the Pursuer’s neck, who barely ejected from the husk in time.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He re-formed and tried to grab Stormblessed again. But there was no contest now. Kaladin moved like the wind, fast and flowing as he rammed <span aria-label="1128" id="pg_1128" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>his dagger through the Pursuer’s arm, causing him to shout in pain. A knife toward the face followed, and the Pursuer ejected yet again. No one chanted or shouted this time, but when Stormblessed turned around, Venli saw his face—and she immediately attuned the Terrors.</p>
<p class="fmtx">His eyes were glowing like a Radiant’s, his face a mask of pain and anguish, but the eyes … she <i class="calibre6">swore</i> the light had a yellowish-red cast to it. Like … like …</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Pursuer appeared near the soldiers at the perimeter by the wall. “Go!” he shouted to his men. “Attack him! Kill him, and then kill the other Radiants! Your orders are chaos and death!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Pursuer charged forward. The soldiers followed, then shied away. They wouldn’t face Stormblessed and those eyes of his, so the Pursuer was left with no choice but to engage. Venli didn’t know if he realized, but he was on his final body. Perhaps he knew he couldn’t run this time, not and salvage any kind of reputation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Stormblessed dashed to him, and they met near the vast window, flashing with lightning. The Pursuer tried to grab him, and Kaladin welcomed it, folding into the deadly embrace—then expertly slamming them both up against the window. Kaladin pressed the Pursuer to the glass—the storm outside flashed, shaking the tower, vibrating it and splashing it with light.</p>
<p class="fmtx">In that moment, Kaladin did something to the window. As he stepped back, he left the Pursuer stuck to the glass, immobilized and lacking the Voidlight to eject his soul. Kaladin didn’t attack. Instead he reached down and infused the ground, but with power that didn’t glow as strong as she thought it should.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Pursuer’s head … it was pulling forward against his neck, his eyes bulging. He groaned, and Venli realized that Stormblessed had infused the ground, then made it <i class="calibre6">pull</i> on the Pursuer’s head. But his body was stuck to the wall.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin turned and strode toward the watching Heavenly Ones as the Pursuer’s head <i class="calibre6">ripped</i> from his body and slammed to the floor with a crunch.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Stormblessed,” Leshwi said, stepping out to meet him. “You have fought and won. Your loss is powerful, I know, as mortals are—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin shoved her aside. He was coming for Venli, she was sure of it. She braced herself, but he stalked past her, leaving her trembling to the Terrors. Instead Kaladin strode for the Heavenly One who was holding his father. Of course.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That Heavenly One panicked as any would. She shot off into the air, carrying the man. Two other Heavenly Ones followed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Stormblessed looked up, then launched into the air using the strange fabrial that mimicked the Lashings.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1129" id="pg_1129" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Venli slumped to the ground, feeling worn out, though she hadn’t done anything. At least it seemed to be over.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But not for the soldiers from the Pursuer’s personal army, who gathered around his corpse. Dead a second time, to the same man. His reputation might be in shambles, but he <i class="calibre6">was</i> still Fused. He would return.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The soldiers turned toward the infirmary, remembering his last orders. They couldn’t kill Stormblessed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But they could finish off the invalid Radiants.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Kaladin could barely see straight. He had only a vague memory of killing the Pursuer. He knew he’d done it, but remembering was hard. Thinking was hard.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He soared upward, chasing the creatures who had taken his father. He heard Lirin’s shouts echoing from above, so he’d gotten his gag off. Each sound condemned Kaladin.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He didn’t actually believe he could save his father. It was as if Lirin was already dead, and was screaming at Kaladin from Damnation. Kaladin wasn’t exactly certain why he followed, but he had to get up high. Perhaps … perhaps he could see better from up high.…</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl streaked ahead of him, entering the shafts that let lifts reach the final tiers of the tower. She landed on the topmost level of Urithiru. Kaladin arrived after activating a second weight halfway through the flight, then swung himself over the railing and deactivated the device in one move. He landed facing a Heavenly One who tried to block his path.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Kaladin …</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">He left that Heavenly One broken and dying, then tore through the upper chambers. Where?</p>
<p class="fmtx">The roof. They’d make for the roof to escape. Indeed, he found another Fused blocking the stairwell up, and Kaladin slammed Navani’s device into the Fused’s chest and locked it in place, sending him flying away, up through the stairwell and off into the sky.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Kaladin … I’ve forgotten.…</i> Syl’s voice. She was zipping around him, but he could barely hear her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin burst out onto the top of the tower. The storm spread out around them, almost to the pinnacle, a dark ocean of black clouds rumbling with discontent.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The last of the Heavenly Ones was here, holding Kaladin’s father. The Fused backed away, shouting something Kaladin couldn’t understand.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Kaladin … I’ve forgotten … the Words.…</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1130" id="pg_1130" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>He advanced on the Heavenly One, and in a panic she threw his father. Out. Into the blackness. Kaladin saw Lirin’s face for a brief moment before he vanished. Into the pit. The swirling storm and tempest.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin scrambled to the edge of the tower and looked down. Suddenly he knew why he’d come this high. He knew where he was going. He’d stood on this ledge before. Long ago in the rain.</p>
<p class="fmtx">This time he jumped.</p>
