<p class="tni"><span aria-label="1055" id="pg_1055" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Hesina made a small notation in her notebook, kneeling above a map she’d rolled out on the floor. The cache Rlain had brought included five maps of Alethkar focused on different princedoms. Sadeas’s was included, with notes about singer troop placements in certain cities and whatever else the scouts had seen while doing reconnaissance of the area.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It had taken her until now to realize she could check on Tomat. The city had several long paragraphs of attached observations, written by Kara the Windrunner. The singers had the city wall under repair, which was incredible on its own. That had been broken since … what, her <i class="calibre6">grandfather’s</i> days? The infamous Gap would be gone if she ever visited again.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She couldn’t find specifics about the people who had lived in the city, but that wasn’t surprising. The Windrunners hadn’t been able to get too close, after all. At least there were no reports of burnt-out houses, as in some other cities. It seemed the city had given in without too much of a fight, which boded well for local survival rates.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She wrote each detail in her notebook, then glanced up as Lirin slipped into their sectioned-off surgery chamber. He let the draped sheets fall closed, fabric rustling. He’d been studying the large model of Urithiru that was at the back of the infirmary room.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You found Tomat?” he asked, adjusting his spectacles and leaning down beside her. “Huh. Anything useful?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not much,” she said. “Similar notes to other cities.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Well, we’d probably know if your father died,” Lirin said, straightening to gather some bandages from the counter.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And how is that?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He’d be haunting me, obviously,” Lirin said. “Living as a shade in the <span aria-label="1056" id="pg_1056" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>storms, calling for my blood. As I haven’t heard a thing, I must assume the old monster is alive.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Hesina rolled up the map and gave her husband a flat glare, which he accepted with a smile and a twinkle to his eye.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s been twenty-five years,” Hesina said. “He might have softened toward you by now.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Stone doesn’t soften with time, dear,” Lirin replied. “It merely grows brittle. I think we’d sooner see a chull fly than see your father grow <i class="calibre6">soft.</i>” He must have noticed that the topic legitimately worried her, because he turned away from the gibes. “I’d bet that he’s fine, Hesina. Some men are too ornery to be bothered by something as mundane as an invasion.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He wouldn’t give up his business easily, Lirin. He’s stubborn as a lighteyes—he’d order his guards to fight, even when everyone else had surrendered.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin returned to his work, and after a short delay, said, “I’m sure he’s fine.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You are thinking that if he lifted a sword,” Hesina said, “he deserved whatever he got.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">And her father <i class="calibre6">would</i> use a sword. Under a special writ of forbearance from the citylord, who—even three decades ago—had been accustomed to doing whatever her father bullied him into doing. She’d met only one man who dared defy him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m thinking,” Lirin said, “that my wife needs a supportive husband, not a self-righteous one.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And our son?” she asked. “Which version of you does he deserve?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin stiffened, bandages held in front of him. She turned away, trying to contain her emotions. She hadn’t planned to snap at him, but … well, she supposed she hadn’t forgiven him for driving Kaladin away.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin quietly stepped over, then settled down on the floor beside her, putting aside the bandages. Then he held up his hands. “What do you want of me, Hesina? Do you want me to abandon my convictions?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I want you,” she said, “to appreciate your incredible son.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“He was supposed to be better than this. He was supposed to be better than … than I am.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Lirin,” she said softly. “You can’t keep blaming yourself for Tien’s death.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Would he be dead if I hadn’t spent all those years defying Roshone? If I hadn’t picked a fight?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We can’t change the past. But if you continue like this, you’ll lose another son.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He looked up, then shifted his eyes away immediately at Hesina’s cold <span aria-label="1057" id="pg_1057" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>glare. “I wouldn’t have let him die,” Lirin said. “If they hadn’t decided to go get that Edgedancer, I’d have gone to Kaladin like they asked.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I know that. But would you have insisted on bringing him here?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Maybe. He could have needed extended care, Hesina. Isn’t it better to bring him here, where I can watch him? Better than letting him go on fighting an impossible battle, getting himself and others killed in this foolish war.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And would you have done that to another soldier?” she pressed. “Say it wasn’t your son who was wounded. Would you have brought <i class="calibre6">that</i> boy here and risked him being imprisoned, maybe executed? You’ve healed soldiers before, sending them back out to fight. That’s always been your conviction. Treat anyone, no strings attached, no matter the circumstances.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Maybe I need to rethink that policy,” he said. “Besides, Kaladin has told me many times that he’s not my son any longer.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Great. I’m glad we could chat so I could persuade you to be <i class="calibre6">more</i> stubborn. I see that your thoughts and feelings are evolving on this topic—and because you’re you, they’re going the absolute <i class="calibre6">wrong</i> direction.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin sighed. He stood and grabbed the stack of bandages, then turned to leave their little draped-off chamber.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Storm it, she wasn’t done with him yet. Hesina rose, surprised at the depth of her frustration. “Don’t you leave,” she snapped, causing him to stop by the drapes.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Hesina,” he said, sounding tired. “What do you <i class="calibre6">want</i> from me?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She stalked over to him, pointing. “I left everything for you, Lirin. Do you know why?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Because you believed in me?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Because I <i class="calibre6">loved</i> you. And I <i class="calibre6">still</i> love you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Love can’t change the realities of our situation.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No, but it <i class="calibre6">can</i> change people.” She seized his hand, less a comforting gesture and more a demand that he remain there with her, so they could face this together. “I know how stressed you feel. I feel it too—feel like I’m going to get <i class="calibre6">crushed</i> by it. But I’m not going to let you continue to pretend Kaladin isn’t your son.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The son I raised would <i class="calibre6">never</i> have committed murder in my surgery room.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your <i class="calibre6">son</i> is a <i class="calibre6">soldier,</i> Lirin. A soldier who inherited his father’s determination, skill, and compassion. You tell me honestly. Who would you rather have out there fighting? Some crazed killer who enjoys it, or the boy you trained to <i class="calibre6">care</i>?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He hesitated, then opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Before you say you don’t want <i class="calibre6">anyone</i> fighting,” Hesina interrupted, <span aria-label="1058" id="pg_1058" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“know that I’ll recognize that as a lie. We both know you’ve admitted that people need to fight sometimes. You simply don’t want it to be your son, despite the fact that he’s probably the <i class="calibre6">best</i> person we could have chosen.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You obviously know the responses you want from me,” Lirin said. “So why should I bother speaking?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Hesina groaned, tipping her head back. “You can be so <i class="calibre6">storming frustrating.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">In return, he squeezed her hand gently. “I’m sorry,” he said, his voice softer. “I’ll try to listen better, Hesina. I promise.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Don’t just listen better,” she said, pulling him out of the draped-off section and waving toward the larger room. “See better. Look. What do you see?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The place was busy with humans who wanted to care for the Radiants. Hesina had instituted a rotation so that everyone got a chance. Beneath the gaze of two watching stormform Regals, people of all ethnicities—and wearing all kinds of clothing—moved among the comatose Radiants. Administering water, changing sheets, brushing hair.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Hesina and Lirin used a more carefully cultivated group—mostly ardents—to handle delicate matters like bathing the patients, but today’s caregivers were common inhabitants of the tower. Darkeyes made up the majority of these, but each and every one wore a <i class="calibre6">shash</i> glyph like Kaladin’s painted on their forehead.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What do you see?” Hesina whispered again to Lirin.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Honestly?” he asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I see fools,” he said, “refusing to accept the truth. Resisting, when they’ll just get crushed.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She heard the words he left off: <i class="calibre6">Like I was.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">She towed him by his arm to one side of the room, where a man with only one arm sat on a stool, painting the glyph on a young girl’s head. She ran off to her duty as Lirin and Hesina arrived. The man stood respectfully. Bearded, wearing a buttoned shirt and trousers, he had three moles on his cheek. He nodded to Hesina and Lirin. Almost a bow. As far as he could go without provoking a reaction from the watching Fused, who didn’t like such signs of respect shown to other humans.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I know you,” Lirin said, narrowing his eyes at the man. “You’re one of the refugees who came to Hearthstone.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m Noril, sir,” the man said. “You sent me to the ardents, on suicide watch. Thank you for trying to help.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Well,” Lirin said, “you seem to be doing better.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Depends on the day, sir,” Noril said. “But I’d say I’m better than I was when you met me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1059" id="pg_1059" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Lirin glanced at Hesina, who squeezed his hand and gestured her chin toward Noril’s forehead and the glyph.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Why do you wear that glyph?” Lirin asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“To honor Stormblessed, who still fights.” Noril nodded, as if to himself. “I’ll be ready when he calls for me, sir.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Don’t you see the irony in that?” Lirin asked. “It was fighting in your homeland that made you flee, and therefore get into all the trouble you’ve faced. Fighting lost you everything. If people would stop with this nonsense, <i class="calibre6">I</i> would have to see far fewer men with battle shock like yours.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Noril settled down on his stool and used his hand to stir his cup of black paint, which he placed between his knees. “Suppose you’re right, sir. Can’t argue with a surgeon about the nonsense we do. But sir, do you know why I get up each day?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Lirin shook his head.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s hard sometimes,” Noril said, stirring. “Coming awake means leaving the nothingness, you know? Remembering the pain. But then I think, ‘Well, <i class="calibre6">he</i> gets up.’”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You mean Kaladin?” Lirin asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, sir,” Noril said. “He’s got the emptiness, bad as I do. I can see it in him. We all can. But he gets up anyway. We’re trapped in here, and we all want to do something to help. We can’t, but somehow he can.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And you know, I’ve listened to ardents talk. I’ve been poked and prodded. I’ve been stuck in the dark. None of that worked as well as knowing this one thing, sir. He still gets up. He still fights. So I figure … I figure I can too.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Hesina squeezed Lirin’s hand again, pulling him away as she thanked Noril with a smile.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You want me to acknowledge,” Lirin whispered, “that what Kaladin’s doing is helping that man, while my surgeon’s treatments could have done nothing.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You said you’d listen,” she said. “You asked what I <i class="calibre6">want</i> of you? I want you to talk to them, Lirin. The people in this room. Don’t challenge them. Don’t argue with them. Simply ask them why they wear that glyph. And <i class="calibre6">see</i> them, Lirin. Please.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She left him standing there and returned to her maps. Trusting in him, and the man she knew he was.</p>
