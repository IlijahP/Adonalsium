<p class="tni">Kaladin landed on the balcony with a muted thump. Syl was a glowing ribbon of light farther into the building. He couldn’t see the scouts who had packed up and left with the spanreeds, but he trusted Syl was watching them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He followed into the darkness, putting his Stormlight into a sphere so he didn’t glow. He had failed to spy on the Oathgates, but if he could somehow steal one of those Voidlight spanreeds, he could still help Navani.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He crept as quickly as he dared in the darkness, one hand on the wall. He soon neared a hallway with lanterns along the wall; as this was the third floor of the tower, much of it was occupied and lit. The lanterns revealed two femalen singers ahead, wearing havahs and chatting quietly. Syl carefully darted into side tunnels and nooks behind them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin trailed far behind, relying on Syl to point out turns, as the two singers were often out of his direct line of sight. This section of the tower was a large laundry facility, where darkeyes could come to use public water and soap. He passed several large rooms without doors where the floor was shaped into a sequence of basins.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was nearly empty now. The tower’s pumps hadn’t been changed to work on Voidlight, it seemed. He did have to avoid several water-carrying teams—humans pulling carts, with singer guards—moving through the <span aria-label="698" id="pg_698" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>tunnels. Syl soon came zipping back, so he ducked into a darkened alcove near an empty room full of baskets for laundry. The place smelled of soap.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Guard post ahead,” she whispered. “They went through it. What do you want to do?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Any Fused nearby?” Kaladin asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not that I saw. Only ordinary singers.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Theoretically, regular guards shouldn’t be able to see you unless you let them. Follow those singers with the spanreeds. Hopefully their rooms are nearby. If they split up, pick the one with the blue havah—the embroidery indicates she’s the more important. Once you know where her room is, come back, then we can sneak in another way and steal the spanreed.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Right. If they get too far away from you though, I’ll lose myself.…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Return if you start to feel that,” he said. “We can try another night.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl soared off without another word, leaving Kaladin hiding inside the room with the baskets. Unfortunately, he soon heard voices—and peeked to see a pair of singers with baskets walking down the hallway. Even an occupying force of ancient evil soldiers needed to do laundry, it seemed. Kaladin closed the door, shutting himself in darkness, then—realizing there was a chance they were coming to dump their baskets in this very room—he grabbed a broom and lashed it across the door.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Since he’d infused the broom on either end, no Stormlight should show through the door. A moment later it rattled as they tried to push it inward. Annoyed voices outside complained in Azish as they tried the door again. He gripped his knife, darkness weighing upon him. The horror of the nightmares, and a fatigue that went far deeper than the earlier strain to his muscles. A tiredness that had been with him so long, he’d accepted it as normal.</p>
<p class="fmtx">When the door rattled again, he was <i class="calibre6">certain</i> it was a dark force come to claim him. He heard the sounds of bowstrings, and of Gaz yelling for the bridgemen to run. Screams of men dying, and … And …</p>
<p class="fmtx">He blinked. The door had fallen still. When … when had that happened? He gave it a few minutes, wiping the sweat from his forehead, then un-Lashed the broom and cracked the door. Two abandoned baskets sat nearby, no singers in sight. He let out a long breath, then pried his fingers off his scalpel and tucked it away.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eventually Syl returned. “They weren’t going to their rooms,” she said, animatedly dancing around in patterns as a ribbon of light. “They dropped off their spanreed in a room ahead where there are <i class="calibre6">dozens</i> of spanreeds, watched over by a couple of senior femalens.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin nodded, breathing deeply, fighting back the tiredness.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You … all right?” Syl asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m fine,” Kaladin said. “That’s a spanreed hub you found. Makes sense <span aria-label="699" id="pg_699" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>they’d set one up in the tower.” Maintaining hundreds of spanreeds could grow unwieldy, so many highlords and highladies would set up hubs. Disparate locations—like guard posts around the tower—could send reports to a central room, where the hub attendants sifted for important information and sent it to those in power.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The singers were keeping their reeds in central locations to be checked out, used, and returned. The reeds wouldn’t go home with individual scribes. This wasn’t going to be as easy as sneaking into a bedroom to grab one, but the hub might offer other opportunities.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We need to get past that guard post,” Kaladin whispered, burying his fatigue.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“There’s something else, Kaladin,” Syl said. “Look out the door, down the tunnel.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Frowning, he did as she requested, peeking out and watching down the tunnel. He was confused, until he saw something pass in the air—like rippling red lightning.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That’s a new kind of Voidspren,” he said. The ones he’d seen in the past that looked like lightning moved along the ground.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s not, though,” Syl said. “That spren should be invisible to people, but something is off about its aura. It is leaving a trail that I noted the guards watching.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Curious. So the tower was interfering with spren invisibility? “Did the guards look at you when you passed?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No, but they might just not have noticed me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin nodded, watching a little longer. That spren in the distance didn’t pass again. “It’s worth the risk,” he decided, “in proceeding. At least we’ll know if we’re being spied upon.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“But what about that guard post?” she asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I doubt we’ll be able to sneak around it,” he said. “They’ll have all directions guarded for something valuable like a spanreed hub. But a lot of these rooms have small tunnels at the tops for ventilation. Perhaps we can sneak through one of those?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl led him carefully to an intersection. He peered right, to where four guards blocked the way, two at either side of the hallway. Spears at the crooks of their arms, they wore Alethi-style uniforms with knots on the shoulders. Kaladin was able to spot one of the ventilation holes nearby, but this one was far too small for him to squeeze into.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He’d stood on guard duty himself like that on a number of occasions. If these four were well trained, there would be no luring them away with simple distractions. If you wanted a path well protected, you often posted four. Two to investigate any disturbances, two to remain vigilant.</p>
<p class="fmtx">With the hallway this narrow, and with those guards looking as alert as <span aria-label="700" id="pg_700" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>they were … Well, he’d been there. The only times when he’d been drawn away, it had involved someone with proper authority commandeering him for another task.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Syl,” he whispered, “you’re getting better at changing colors. Do you think you could change your coloring to appear like a Voidspren?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She cocked her head, standing beside him in the air, then scrunched up her face in a look of concentration. Her dress changed to red, but not her “skin,” even though it was simply another part of her. Strange.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I think this is all I can manage,” she said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Then make the dress cover your hands with gloves and put on a mask.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She cocked her head, then changed her clothing so she was wrapped in phantom cloth. That bled to a deep red, making her entire form glow with that color.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She inspected her arms. “Do you think it will fool them?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It might,” Kaladin said. He pulled a length of rope from his sack, then Lashed it to the wall. “Go order all four of them to come with you, then pull them over here to look at this.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“But … doesn’t that rope risk causing a bigger disturbance? Like, what if they go for backup?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We need something reasonable enough to have caused a Voidspren to get riled up. I know guard duty though, and those are common warforms. Regular soldiers. I’m guessing that so long as there’s no danger, they’ll just make a report on it.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He hid down a side hallway, waiting as Syl flew off toward the guard post. She didn’t look exactly like a Voidspren, but it was a reasonable approximation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She drew near to the post, then spoke loudly enough that he heard her easily. “You there! I am super annoyed! Super, super annoyed! How can you stand there? Didn’t you see?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Brightness?” one of them said, in Alethi. “Er, Ancient One? We are to—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Come on, come on! No, all of you. Come see this! Right now. I’m really annoyed! Can’t you tell?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin waited, tense. Would it work? Even when acting angry, there was a certain perkiness to Syl’s voice. She sounded too … lively to be a Voidspren.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The guards followed though—and as he’d hoped, the glowing length of rope on the wall caught their attention entirely. Kaladin was able to sneak out behind them, passing the post.</p>
<p class="fmtx">At the end of this hallway was the door Syl said led into the spanreed room. Kaladin didn’t dare slip through it; he’d step directly into the middle of a hub of activity. Instead he prowled into a smaller hallway to the <span aria-label="701" id="pg_701" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>right—and here he finally caught a break. High up on the wall, near the ceiling, a dark cleft indicated a large ventilation shaft in the stone. Maybe big enough for him to squeeze through.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl returned—once again white-blue, and likely invisible. “They’re sending one of their number to make a report,” she said. “Like you said.” She peeked into the shaft in the rock Kaladin had found. “What is this?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Ventilation?</i> he thought, trying to send the idea to her so he wouldn’t have to make noise.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It worked. “Seems too big for that,” she said. “This place is so strange.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">With two of his brushes, Kaladin was able to haul himself up and inspect the cleft in the stone. Syl flew into the darkened shaft toward some light at the other end. He heard the guards talking as they came back, but he was around the corner from them now, out of sight.</p>
<p class="fmtx">This ventilation shaft looked like it turned toward the spanreed room just to the left. It <i class="calibre6">was</i> big enough. Maybe.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl waved, excited. So he squeezed in. It was more than wide enough to the right and left, but it was barely high enough. He had to move using his brush handholds to pull himself along. He worried the scraping sounds he made would give him away—but he was rewarded when the shaft opened up to the left, revealing a small, well-lit room. The shaft he’d entered ran through the middle of the large thick wall between this room and whatever was on the other side.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That meant Kaladin was able to peek in—hidden mostly behind the stone—at the room from the top of the wall. Spanreeds stood poised on many pieces of paper, waiting for reports. There was no sign of the two singer women from earlier—they’d delivered their spanreed and gone off duty. However, two other femalens in rich dresses maintained the reeds, checking for blinking lights and moving reeds between actively writing on boards and inactive piles on the tables.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl entered, and none of them glanced at her, so she seemed to actually be invisible. So, she began reading the reports that were coming in. The door opened and one of the guards entered, requesting a report be sent to his superior. They’d found what appeared to be the sign of a Radiant—something the Pursuer had told everyone to watch for.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin might not have much time before the creature himself arrived. Best to move quickly. As the guard left, Kaladin quietly maneuvered in the tight quarters, reaching to his waist and pulling out some of his rope. Directly beneath him was a table with a number of spanreeds, including a leather case that had a few nibs sticking out of it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He needed to wait for the perfect moment. Fortunately, several spanreeds started blinking at once—and they must have been important ones, for the two femalens quickly turned to these and stopped working on the <span aria-label="702" id="pg_702" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>soldier’s report. Kaladin Lashed his rope to one of his brushes, then infused the flat of the brush with a Reverse Lashing—commanding it to attract certain objects only. In this instance, that leather case.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The femalens were so preoccupied that Kaladin felt his chance had come. He lowered the brush on the rope toward the table. As the brush drew near, the leather case moved of its own volition, pulled over so it stuck to the brush.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Heart thumping, certain he was about to be caught, Kaladin drew it up, the case sticking to the end, the spanreeds inside clinking softly. Nobody noticed, and he pulled it into the shaft.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Inside the case, he found an entire group of spanreeds—at least twenty. Perhaps they’d just been delivered, as they were still wrapped in pairs, with twine around them. Judging by the way the rubies glowed with Voidlight, he was hopeful that they would work in the tower.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He tucked the large pouch away in his sack. He then spared a thought for all the important information that was likely being relayed through this room. Could he steal some of it?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No.</i> He’d already risked enough today. He sent a quick thought to Syl, who came zipping up to him as he wiggled backward through the ventilation shaft. She flitted on ahead of him, then called from behind, “Hallway is empty.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He eased out of the hole, catching the edge with his fingers and hanging a moment before quietly dropping the last few feet to the floor of the corridor. He peeked back out toward the guard post.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Now what?” Syl said. “Want me to imitate a Voidspren again?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He nodded. Part of him wanted to try another path, as he worried that these soldiers might grow suspicious at the same ruse. But he also knew they’d fallen for it once, and he knew a direct way to the perimeter using this path. Safer this way.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As Syl was getting ready, however, Kaladin spotted something farther down this hallway, away from the guards. A flashing light. He held up his hand to stop Syl, then pointed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What is that?” she said, zipping off toward the light. He followed more cautiously, stepping up to a blinking garnet light. Frowning, Kaladin pressed his hand against it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Brightness Navani?” he asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No,</i> a voice said. It had a middling pitch, not necessarily male or female. <i class="calibre6">I need you, Radiant. Please. They’ve found me.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“You?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">One of the nodes! That protect me. Please. Please, you have to defend it. Please.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">“How do you know? Have you told Brightness Navani?”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Please.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="703" id="pg_703" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Where?” he said.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Second level, near the central atrium. I will lead you. They realized that one of the nodes would be open to the air, to be renewed by Stormlight. They’ve sent for her. The Lady of Pains. She’ll take my mind. Please, Radiant. Protect me.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl hovered beside him. “What?” she asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He lowered his hand. He was so tired.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But today, he couldn’t afford to be tired. He had to be Kaladin Stormblessed. Kaladin Stormblessed fought anyway.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’re going to need to find me a better weapon,” he said. “Quickly.”</p>
