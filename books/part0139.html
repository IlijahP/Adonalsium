<p class="tni">Rlain found her crying.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli could count on her fingers the number of times she could remember crying. Not merely attuning Mourning, but actually <i class="calibre6">crying.</i> Today she couldn’t help herself. She knelt in the sectioned-off part of the infirmary room, overlooking the large map of the Shattered Plains that Rlain had stolen. She was alone. Lirin and Hesina were in the main room, seeing to the patients.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A note on the map hinted at what Raboniel had said: a group of nomads in the hills. Her people. They had <i class="calibre6">survived.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">She turned to Rlain, who—shocked—was humming to Awe at finding her like this.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’re not the last,” Venli whispered. “They are alive, Rlain. Thousands of them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Who?” He knelt. “What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli wiped her eyes—she wouldn’t have her tears destroying this glorious map. Venli handed him the note Raboniel had given her, but of course he couldn’t read. So she read it out loud for him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You mean…” he said, attuning Awe. “Thousands of them?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It was Thude,” Venli said. “He refused stormform. So did most of Eshonai’s closest friends. I … I wasn’t thinking back then.… I would have had them killed, but Eshonai separated them off and <i class="calibre6">let</i> them escape. Part of her fought, so she gave them a chance, and … And then…”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1035" id="pg_1035" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Storms, she was a mess. She wiped her eyes again.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You would have had them <i class="calibre6">killed</i>?” Rlain asked. “Venli, I don’t understand. What is it you’re not telling me?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Everything,” she whispered to Pleading. “A thousand lies, Rlain.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Venli,” he said, taking her hand. “Kaladin is awake. Teft is too. We have a plan. The start of one, at least. I came to explain it to Lirin and Hesina. We’re going to try to wake the Radiants, but we need to get those stormforms out of the room. If you know something that might help, now would be a good time to talk.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Help?” Venli whispered. “Nothing I do helps. It only hurts.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Rlain hummed to Confusion. At a gentle prompting from Timbre, Venli started talking. She began with the strange human woman who had given her the sphere, and went all the way up to when Thude and the others left.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She didn’t hide her part in it. She didn’t coat it with the Rhythm of Consolation. She gave it to him raw. The whole terrible story.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As she spoke, he pulled farther and farther away from her. His expression changed, his eyes widening, his rhythms moving from shocked to angry. As she might have expected. As she wanted.</p>
<p class="fmtx">When she finished, they sat in silence.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You are a monster,” he finally said. “<i class="calibre6">You</i> did this. You are responsible.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She hummed to Consolation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I suppose the enemy would have found another way,” he said, “without your help. Regardless, Venli. You … I mean…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I need to find them,” she said, rolling up the map. “There are daily transfers to Kholinar. Raboniel has released me from my duties here, and given me a writ allowing me to requisition whatever I need. I should be able to procure a spot in the next transfer, and from there go with some Heavenly Ones on a scouting mission out to the Shattered Plains.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And in so doing, you’d lead the enemy directly to our people,” Rlain said. “Venli, Raboniel obviously <i class="calibre6">wants</i> you to do this. She knows you’re going to run to them. You’re playing into whatever plot she has.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She’d considered that. She wasn’t exactly in the most rational state of mind, however. “I have to do something, Rlain,” she whispered. “I need to see them with my own eyes, even if I have to <i class="calibre6">walk</i> there.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I agree, we should do that as soon as it’s reasonable,” Rlain said. He glanced toward the curtains, then spoke more quietly. “But now isn’t the time. We have to save the Radiants.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Do you <i class="calibre6">really</i> want me there when you do, Rlain? Do you want me around?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He fell silent, then hummed to Betrayal.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Smart,” she said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I don’t want you around right now, Venli,” he said. “But storm me, we <span aria-label="1036" id="pg_1036" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">need</i> you. And I think you’re trustworthy. You told me this, after all. And who knows how much of what you did was influenced by your forms or those Voidspren?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“For now, let’s work on saving the Radiants. If you’re truly sorry for what you did, then this is the best way to prove it. After that, we can seek out our people <i class="calibre6">without</i> leading the Fused to them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She looked away, then hummed to Betrayal herself. “No. This isn’t my fight, Rlain. It never was. I have to go see if this map is true. I have to.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Fine,” he snapped. He stood to leave, then paused. “You know, all those months running bridges—then training with Kal and the others—I wondered. I wondered deep down if I was a traitor. I now realize I didn’t have the first <i class="calibre6">notes</i> of understanding what it meant to be a traitor.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He ducked out between the curtains. Venli quietly tucked the map of the Shattered Plains into its case, then put it under her arm. It was time for her to go.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She found both Dul and Mazish caring for the fallen Radiants. Venli pulled them aside, and whispered, “The time has come. Are we ready to leave?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Finally,” Dul said to Excitement. “We’ve siphoned away rations, canteens of water, blankets, and some extra clothing from what we were given to care for the Radiants. Harel has it all ready in packs, hidden among the other supplies in the storage room we were given.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The people are ready,” Mazish said. “Eager. We think we can survive in the cold up here for months.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We’ll need those supplies,” Venli said, “but we might not have to survive in the mountains. Look.” She showed them the writ of authority Raboniel had given her. “With this, we can get through the Oathgates, no questions asked.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Maybe,” Dul said to Appreciation. “So we go to Kholinar, but then what? We’re back where we began.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We take the supplies, and we use this writ to leave the city,” Venli explained. “We hike out to the east and disappear into the wilderness to the east of Alethkar, like my ancestors did so many generations ago.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Then we make our way to the Shattered Plains,</i> she thought. But … that would take too long. Could Venli find a way to scout ahead, using the aid of the Heavenly Ones? Perhaps get dropped off nearer the Unclaimed Hills, without revealing what she was truly seeking?</p>
<p class="fmtx">It seemed a lot to demand of this one writ. Plus, Raboniel knew about the listeners who had survived. Surely she’d eventually tell the other Fused.</p>
<p class="fmtx">For the moment, Venli didn’t care. “Gather the others,” she whispered. “The humans are going to attempt to rescue the Radiants here soon. The chaos should cover our escape. I want us to leave in the next day or two.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="1037" id="pg_1037" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The other two attuned Resolve; they trusted her. More than she trusted herself. Venli doubted she would find redemption among the listeners who had escaped the Fused. In fact, she expected accusation, condemnation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But … Venli <i class="calibre6">had</i> to try to reach them. For when they’d escaped, they’d taken her mother with them. Jaxlim might be dead—and if not, her mind would still be lost to age.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But she was also the last person—the <i class="calibre6">only</i> person—who might still love Venli, despite it all.</p>
