<p class="ep"><span aria-label="297" id="pg_297" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">Dear Wanderer,</span></p>
<p class="ltsai"><span class="esans_caslonantique_italic_i_">I did receive your latest communication. Please forgive formality on my part, as we have not met in person. I feel new to this role, despite my years holding it. You will admit to my relative youth, I think.</span></p>
<p class="tni">Radiant marched through a chamber deep beneath Urithiru, listening to the crashing sound of the waterworks and worrying about the mission Shallan had agreed to undertake. Volunteering to visit the honorspren? Traveling into Shadesmar?</p>
<p class="fmtx">That positioned them to do as Mraize had tasked them. Again.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant did not like Mraize, and she certainly didn’t trust him. However, she would keep to the agreement: the will of two should be respected. Veil wished to participate in the Ghostbloods wholeheartedly. Shallan wanted to work with them long enough to find out what they knew. So Radiant would not go to Dalinar and Jasnah. The compact meant harmony, and harmony meant the ability to function.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Mraize wants something out of this Restares person,</i> Veil thought. <i class="calibre6">I can feel it. We need to find out what that secret is, then use it. We can’t do that from here.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">A valid enough point. Radiant clasped her hands behind her back and continued her walk along the edge of the vast reservoir as her Lightweavers trained nearby. She had chosen to wear her vakama, the traditional Veden warrior’s clothing. It was similar to the Alethi takama, but the skirt was pleated instead of straight. She wore a loose matching coat with a tight vest and shirt beneath.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The bright clothing featured vibrant blues embroidered over reds with <span aria-label="298" id="pg_298" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>gold woven between, and it had trim on the skirt. She’d noticed the Alethi doing double takes—both for the variegated colors, and because she wore what was traditionally a man’s outfit. But a warrior was who she was, and Jah Keved was her heritage. She would convey both.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The room echoed with a low roar. Openings high in the walls on the other side of the reservoir let streams gush down and crash into the basin. The noise was distant enough to not disturb conversation, and the longer she practiced here, the more comforting she found the sound of rushing water. It was a natural thing, but contained, restrained. It seemed to represent humankind’s mastery over the elements.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">So we must master ourselves,</i> Radiant thought—and Veil approved. Radiant was careful not to think poorly of Veil. Though their methods differed, they both existed to protect and help Shallan. Radiant respected Veil’s efforts there. She had accomplished things Radiant could not.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Indeed, perhaps Veil could have been persuaded to talk to Dalinar and Jasnah. But Shallan … the idea frightened Shallan.</p>
<p class="fmtx">That deep wound had surprised Radiant as it began to emerge this last year. Radiant was pleased with the improvement they’d made in working together, but this wound was impeding further progress. It seemed similar to what often happened with strength training. You eventually reached a plateau—and sometimes getting to new heights required more pain first.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They’d get through this. It might seem like regression, but Radiant was certain this last knot of agony was the final answer. The final truth. Shallan was <i class="calibre6">terrified</i> that the ones she loved would turn on her when they found out the extent of her crimes. But she <i class="calibre6">needed</i> to confront her truths.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Radiant would do what she could to help ease that burden. Today, that meant helping prepare for the mission into Shadesmar. Veil could fulfill Mraize’s demand and find this Restares person. Radiant would instead make certain the official side of their journey—speaking to the honorspren and pleading for them to join the war—was handled competently.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She turned and inspected her Lightweavers. She brought them to this chamber under the tower because they didn’t like to train in the standard sparring halls. Though Radiant would have preferred them to associate with other soldiers, she had reluctantly agreed to find them a more private place. Their powers were … unusual, and could be distracting.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Nearby, Beryl and Darcira—two of her newer Lightweavers—changed faces as they fought. Diversions, to put their opponent off guard. Curiously, when wearing new faces, both women attacked more recklessly. Many Lightweavers, when offered a part to play, threw themselves into it wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It didn’t seem they had the same mental crisis as Shallan, fortunately. They just liked acting, and sometimes took it too far. If given a helmet, <span aria-label="299" id="pg_299" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>they’d stand up and shout orders like a battle commander. Wearing the right face they’d argue politics, stand in front of a crowd, even lob insults at the mighty. But catch either of these two women alone, wearing her own face? They’d speak in muted voices and avoid crowds, seeking to curl up quietly and read.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Beryl, Darcira,” Radiant said, interrupting the women. “I like how you are learning to control your powers—but today’s task is to practice the sword. Try to watch your footwork more than your transformations. Darcira, when you wear a male face, you always lose your stance.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Guess I feel more aggressive,” Darcira said, shrugging as her Lightweaving puffed away, revealing her normal features.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You must control the face rather than let it control you,” Radiant said. Inside she felt Shallan forming a wisecrack—the Three had their own trouble with that idea. “When you’re fighting, and you intend to distract someone, don’t let that distract <i class="calibre6">you</i> as well.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“But Radiant,” Beryl said, waving toward her side sword, “why do we even <i class="calibre6">have</i> to learn to fight? We’re spies. If we have to pick up our swords, haven’t we already lost?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“There may be times when you will need to pretend to be a soldier. In that case, using the sword could be part of your disguise. But yes, fighting is our last resort. I would have it be a <i class="calibre6">viable</i> last resort—if you need to break disguise and abandon your cover, I want you to survive and return to us.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The young woman thought on that. She was a few years older than Shallan, but a few years younger than how Radiant saw herself. Beryl claimed to have forgotten her real name, she’d lived so many different lives. Veil had found her after hearing rumors of a prostitute working in the warcamps whose face changed to match that of people her clients most loved.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A hard life, but not an uncommon story for the Lightweavers. Half of Radiant’s band of twenty included the deserters Shallan had first recruited. Those men might not have forgotten their former lives, but there were certainly parts in the middle they’d rather not discuss.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Beryl and Darcira took Radiant’s tips—which were really Adolin’s tips, drilled into her brain over many nights practicing—and returned to their sparring.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I couldn’t spot her Cryptic,” Radiant said as she walked away to inspect the others.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Mmm?” Pattern said, riding on her back, right below her collar. “Pattern? She usually rides on the inside of Beryl’s shirt, near her skin. Pattern doesn’t like to be seen.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’d prefer if you used the Cryptic’s other name,” Radiant said. “It’s confusing, otherwise.” After being pressured, each of the other Cryptics had picked individual names for the humans to use.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="300" id="pg_300" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I don’t understand why,” he said. “Our names are already all different. I am Pattern. She is Pattern. Gaz has Pattern.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Those … are the same words, Pattern.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“But they’re not,” he said. “Mmm. I could write the numbers for you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Humans can’t speak equations as intonations,” Radiant said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Like most of Shallan’s team, Beryl and Darcira already had their own spren—though they had yet to earn their swords. That meant they weren’t squires according to the Windrunner definition. Cryptics weren’t as uptight as honorspren, and didn’t wait as long to start bonds. Everyone in her team had one at this point, and newcomers got them quickly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">So her team had begun using their own terminology. Shallan was the Master Lightweaver. The others were Agent Lightweavers. If someone new joined, they were called a squire during the short time before they acquired a spren. Together, they’d begun calling themselves the Unseen Court. Both Veil and Shallan loved the title … though Radiant had noticed more than a few eye rolls from Windrunners when it was mentioned.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She completed her round of the room, the walking portion of which was shaped like a crescent. She looked over her twenty agents, and started deliberating on the true question at hand: Which ones should she take with her into Shadesmar?</p>
<p class="fmtx">She and Adolin had agreed that the team should be small. Shallan and Adolin, along with three Radiants: Godeke the Edgedancer, Zu the Stoneward, and the Truthwatcher woman who preferred to be called by her nickname, the Stump. They’d bring some of Adolin’s soldiers as grooms and guards—and he’d choose men who <i class="calibre6">hadn’t</i> been on the mission to the warcamps, just in case.</p>
<p class="fmtx">In addition they wanted three Lightweaver agents to Soulcast food, water, and other materials. It was a practical decision, and would also give some of Shallan’s people experience with Shadesmar. Radiant approved, but she had to deal with one discomforting problem.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Did the Ghostbloods really have a spy among her agents? Veil emerged at this contemplation, and took control. She had to prepare for the possibility that one of the other Lightweavers might betray her if brought on this mission. <i class="calibre6">There must be a spy,</i> she thought, <i class="calibre6">and it will be someone who was on the mission to the warcamps. Because whoever they are, they killed Ialai.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Shallan agreed with this. Though Radiant, for some odd reason, seemed uncertain at that logic.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Well, Veil needed to figure out who the most likely candidates were—then make certain they went on the mission to Shadesmar.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">What?</i> Radiant thought. <i class="calibre6">No, if we suspect them of being a spy, we should keep them far away.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No,</i> Veil replied. <i class="calibre6">We keep them close. To better manipulate and watch them.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="301" id="pg_301" role="doc-pagebreak"></span><i class="calibre6">That would be reckless.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">And what would you rather have, Radiant?</i> Veil asked. <i class="calibre6">An enemy you can see, watch, and maybe fight—or one you leave off somewhere, doing who knows what?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">That was more of a valid point. Veil surrendered control to Shallan, who knew the team the best. And as she strolled through the room—her hair bleeding to red—she found herself planning. How did she identify which agents were most likely to be a spy?</p>
<p class="fmtx">She started by walking over to where Ishnah was sparring. The short woman’s straight black hair framed a face accented by bright red lip paint, and she wore an Alethi havah with a gloved hand instead of a sleeve. Ishnah was one of those who had earned her Blade. By Windrunner terms, she should be off gathering her own squires and making her own team—they seemed to assume everyone would want to follow their command structure. The Unseen Court, however, didn’t care for Windrunner methods.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Instead, the Unseen Court would remain together. A balanced team, with roughly equal men and women, as all but one of her new recruits over the year had been female. Indeed, Shallan felt the Court was complete. Beryl had been with them for nearly three months now, and Shallan hadn’t felt a need to recruit anyone else. She wanted a tight-knit group. Hopefully other groups of Lightweavers would come to join the Radiants—but they would form their own teams.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Ishnah had once wanted to join the Ghostbloods. Could the woman have found her way to Mraize? Would she have agreed to watch Shallan? It was possible, making Ishnah a prime suspect. That hurt Shallan to consider, to the point that she forced Radiant to take over again.</p>
<p class="fmtx">What of Vathah? Radiant glanced toward him. The brutish former deserter was the most naturally talented Lightweaver. He often used his powers without recognizing it—even now as he sparred with Red, he’d made himself appear taller and more muscular. He had joined her under protest, and never <i class="calibre6">quite</i> seemed tamed by modern society. How much of a bribe would it take to coax him to spy on her?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We’re going to have to be careful, Radiant,</i> Shallan said from within. <i class="calibre6">The Court could tear itself apart thinking like this.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Somehow Radiant had to distrust them all while encouraging them to trust one another.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ishnah,” Radiant said, “what do you think of the mission we’ve been given?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Ishnah dismissed her Shardblade and walked over. “Going into the dark, Brightness? That place offers opportunities. The ones who master it will get ahead quickly.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was a pragmatic but ambitious attitude. Ishnah always saw opportunities. Her Cryptic tended to ride about on the ornament on the end of the <span aria-label="302" id="pg_302" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>central hairspike she used to keep her braids in place. Much smaller than Pattern, this one constantly made new designs on the surface of the pale white sphere.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Adolin and I have decided to bring a small group,” Radiant said. “The honorspren need to be met with a coalition of spren and Radiants, not an overwhelming group of Cryptics—particularly considering they don’t much care for them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“From what I’ve heard,” Ishnah replied, “the honorspren don’t much like anyone.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This is true,” Radiant said. “But Syl has told me that while they don’t trust Cryptics, honorspren don’t hate them like they do inkspren or highspren. I have decided to bring three Lightweavers along with me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Can I have one of the slots?” Ishnah said. “I want to see more of the spren world.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Mraize’s spy would volunteer for the mission,</i> Veil noted.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will consider it,” Radiant said. “If you were going to take two others, who would they be?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not sure,” Ishnah said. “The more experienced would be more useful, but the newer recruits could learn a lot—and we don’t expect this mission to be dangerous. I guess I’d ask around and see who wanted to go.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A wise suggestion,” Radiant said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">And a clear way to begin hunting the spy. Inside, Shallan squirmed again. She <i class="calibre6">hated</i> thinking about one of her friends being a traitor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Well, Radiant hoped it wasn’t Ishnah. The woman had survived the fall of Kholinar with admirable grit. She’d stared one of the worst disasters in modern history in the face and had not only weathered it, but had helped Kaladin’s squires rescue the crown prince. She would be a great advantage on this mission, but Radiant wasn’t certain—despite what Veil said—that they wanted to bring suspicious ones along.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She made another quick circuit of her people, joined by Ishnah, and gauged their eagerness to go on the mission. Most were ambivalent. They wanted to prove themselves, but stories of Shadesmar disturbed them. In the end, she had a short list of the most eager. Ishnah, naturally. Vathah and Beryl, the former prostitute, and Stargyle, the male recruit she’d picked up before Beryl. A tall fellow who was talented at seeing into Shadesmar.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">These four were already among the most suspicious,</i> Veil thought. <i class="calibre6">Ishnah, who knows about the Ghostbloods. Vathah, who is always so quiet, so dark, hard to read. Beryl and Stargyle, our newest recruits—and therefore least known to me and the others.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">All had been on the mission to the warcamps. So, did she bring three of these four as Veil wanted, or leave them behind as Radiant wanted? Little <span aria-label="303" id="pg_303" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>as she wanted it right now, Shallan took control at the urging of the other two. She had to make the deciding vote.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Strong. With Veil and Radiant supporting her, she found she <i class="calibre6">could</i> face this. She made her decision—she’d leave these four behind, and pick others who hadn’t been on the mission to the Shattered Plains.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She started toward Ishnah to break the news to her, but felt something like nausea. A twisting of her insides. She hunched over, then tried to suppress it, embarrassed to so suddenly lose control. But then, appearing foolish in front of the others was a small price to pay for an opportunity. And really, if it made them underestimate her, then what harm was done? Veil could use that; she could use most anything.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil cleared her throat and took a few deep breaths.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You all right, Brightness?” Ishnah asked, walking up.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Fine,” Veil said. “I’ve made my decision; you’ll be joining me in Shadesmar. Would you kindly go tell Vathah and Stargyle that I’d like them to join us as well? I’ll do as you suggested—one more practiced Lightweaver for the resource they offer, one newer agent to learn from the experience.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Great,” Ishnah said. “That puts Red in charge during our absence, I suppose? And I assume you could come up with some Lightweaving exercises everyone else can perform while we’re gone.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Perfect,” Veil said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Ishnah grinned as she hurried off. Yes, she <i class="calibre6">did</i> feel suspicious. And if Veil had chosen wrong? Well, she suspected the true spy would somehow end up on the mission anyway. Mraize would make certain of it.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">The compact,</i> Shallan thought. <i class="calibre6">Veil … we agreed …</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">But this was <i class="calibre6">important.</i> Veil <i class="calibre6">had</i> to find out which one of them was the spy. She <i class="calibre6">couldn’t</i> let them stay behind and fester.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We don’t even know if there</i> is <i class="calibre6">a spy,</i> Radiant said. <i class="calibre6">We can’t take too much of what Mraize says as truth.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Well, they would see. Leaving your suspected spy <i class="calibre6">behind,</i> so they could run amok unwatched? They would poison her friends against her. Besides, once she unmasked the actual spy, Veil could use this knowledge against Mraize.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She braced herself for anger from Radiant at breaking the compact. It did set a dangerous precedent, didn’t it?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">This is important to you, I see,</i> Radiant thought. She felt strangely quiet. <i class="calibre6">I change my vote, then. I agree to bring them with us.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil found this odd. Was Radiant well? Just in case, Veil kept control. She stood tall, trying to appear puffed up like Radiant always acted—as if she wanted to be bigger than she was, some hulking monster in armor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Veil held full control all through the rest of the day. She almost let <span aria-label="304" id="pg_304" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>go—Shallan was <i class="calibre6">pounding</i> at her from the inside, and that kind of mental doublethink could really wear a woman down. However, Veil needed to see to the rest of the preparations. The mission would be leaving in mere days.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Only when Veil stepped into her rooms—late into the evening—did she begin to relax her grip. However, on the floor inside the room she found a green feather. Mraize?</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was a sign. Veil scanned the room, and her eyes landed on a dresser near the door to the bedroom. A green cloth peeked from one of the drawers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Holding an amethyst mark for light, she eased the drawer open. Inside she found a metal cube roughly the size of a person’s head. The note on it was in one of Mraize’s ciphers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Mmm…” Pattern said from where he dimpled the skirt of her vakama. “What is it, Veil?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Damnation. She’d hoped to be able to fool Pattern into thinking she was Shallan, but of course he saw through her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A note.” She showed it to him, holding the light near the text. “Can you break the cipher, or do I have to go dig out the notebook Mraize gave us?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I memorized the patterns. It reads, ‘Spanreeds do not work between realms, but this will. Be <i class="calibre6">very</i> careful with it. It has a value beyond that of some kingdoms. Do not open it, or you risk destroying it. Once on your mission and in a secluded place, hold the cube and call my name. I will speak to you through it. Good hunting, little knife.’”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Curious. She immediately glimpsed into Shadesmar, and found a sphere of light on the other side, glowing with a strange mother-of-pearl coloring. There was power inside the cube, but no Stormlight. Her attention back to the Physical Realm, she shook it and knocked on the sides. It seemed hollow, but she couldn’t find the slightest crack in it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Storms. How was she going to hide <i class="calibre6">this</i> from Adolin? Well, she’d have to find a way. She would make another trip into Shadesmar, but not by accident. Veil would go on her terms—and she would not spend this trip running.</p>
<p class="fmtx">This time, <i class="calibre6">she</i> was the hunter.</p>
