<p class="tni">Kaladin awoke to something dark attacking him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He screamed, struggling against the clinging shadows. They’d been assaulting him for an eternity, wrapping around him, constricting him. Voices that never relented, fingers of shadow that drilled into his brain.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He was in a dark place full of red light, and the shadows laughed and danced around him. They tormented him, flayed him, stabbed him again and again and wouldn’t let him die. He fought back the hands that gripped, then he crawled across the floor, pulling up against the wall and breathing shallowly. The rushing sounds of his own blood in his ears drowned out the laughter.</p>
<p class="fmtx">One shadow continued watching him. One terrible shadow. It stared at him, then turned and took something from beside the wall before vanishing. Vanishing … out the door.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin blinked, and the shadows melted from his mind. The terrible laughter, the phantom pain, the whispers. His mind always interpreted those as Moash’s voice.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A nightmare. Another nightmare.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Kaladin?” Syl asked. She sat on the floor in front of him. He blinked, glancing sharply one way, then the other. The room seemed to settle into <span aria-label="803" id="pg_803" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>place. Teft sleeping on the stone bench. A few chips set out for light. Fearspren, like globs of goo, undulating in the corners.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I…” He swallowed, his mouth dry. “I had a nightmare.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I know.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He carefully relaxed his posture, embarrassed at how he must appear huddled up by the wall. Like a child frightened of the dark. He couldn’t afford to be a child. Too much depended on him. He stood up, his clothing sweaty. “What time is it?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Midday,” she said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My schedule is completely off.” He tried to pull himself together as he stepped over to get a drink, but he stumbled and caught himself on the ledge. He had to grip it tightly as the nightmare threatened to resurface. Stormfather. This was the most oppressive one yet.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Kaladin…” Syl said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He took a long drink, then froze.</p>
<p class="fmtx">His spear was gone from beside the door.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What happened?” he demanded, slamming the tin cup down harder than he’d intended. “Where is my spear!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The Sibling contacted us,” she said, still sitting on the floor. “That’s why Dabbid tried to wake you. Another node has been found—<i class="calibre6">inside</i> the well in the market. The enemy is there already.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Storms!” Kaladin said. “We need to go.” He reached for Navani’s fabrial and his pouch of gems. He found the latter, but the fabrial was gone.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Dabbid?” Kaladin demanded.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You were huddled there muttering,” Syl said, finally lifting into the air. “And you didn’t seem to be able to see me. The Sibling is terrified. I could hear them while sitting on Dabbid’s shoulder. And so…”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin grabbed the bag of gems and dashed out of the room, Syl following as a ribbon of light. He caught up with Dabbid at the first stairwell—just two hallways over. The shorter bridgeman stood with the spear and fabrial held close to his chest, staring down with a panicked expression.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He jumped as he saw Kaladin, then let out a loud relieved sigh. Kaladin took the fabrial.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You were going to go try to stop the Fused,” Kaladin said. “Because I didn’t get up.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid nodded.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Dabbid, you barely know how to use a spear,” Kaladin said, quickly strapping on the fabrial. He’d had only four days of practice with the device. It would have to be enough.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid didn’t respond, of course. He helped Kaladin strap the fabrial on, then held out the spear.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="804" id="pg_804" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Kaladin took it, then gave the Bridge Four salute.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid returned it. Then, remarkably, said something, in a voice soft and gravelly. “Life. Before. Death.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Storms. Those were the first words Kaladin had ever heard from the man. He grinned, gripping Dabbid by the shoulder. “Life before death, Dabbid.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dabbid nodded. There wasn’t time for more; Kaladin turned away from the stairwell and began running again. Screams from the nightmare echoed in his head, but he didn’t have time for weakness. He had to stop the corruption of that gemstone—and barring that, he had to destroy the node. That was the only way to buy Navani the time she needed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He had to get there quickly, which meant he couldn’t use the stairs. He’d have to go straight down through the atrium.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">“I need to see the Lady of Wishes immediately!” Navani proclaimed to the guard. “I’ve made a discovery of incalculable value! It cannot wait for—”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The guard—a Regal stormform—simply started walking and gestured for her to follow. He didn’t even need the full explanation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Excellent,” Navani said, joining him in the hallway. “I’m glad you see the urgency.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">The guard walked her to the large stairwell that led up to the ground floor. A Deepest One stood here, her fingers laced before her. “What is it?” she asked in heavily accented Alethi. “A sudden illness?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No,” Navani said, taken aback. “A discovery. I think I’ve found what the Lady of Wishes was searching for.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“But of course you can’t share it with anyone but Raboniel herself,” the Fused said, a faintly amused rhythm to her voice.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Well, I mean…” Navani trailed off.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ll see if I can reach her via spanreed,” the Fused said. “I’ll tell her it is <i class="calibre6">most</i> urgent.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Storms. They were <i class="calibre6">expecting</i> an attempted distraction from Navani. That thought was reinforced as the Fused glided to a cabinet that had been set up by the wall. She carefully, but slowly, selected a spanreed from the collection stored there.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was a reverse distraction. They’d <i class="calibre6">known</i> Navani would attempt something like this. But how had they known that <i class="calibre6">she</i> would know that …</p>
<p class="fmtx">She stepped back, her eyes widening as the terrible implications struck her. Kaladin was in serious danger.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni"><span aria-label="805" id="pg_805" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Barefoot and armed with a spear, Kaladin burst out onto the walkway around the atrium, then hurled himself out into the open space eleven stories in the air. Full of Stormlight—hoping it would save him in case this didn’t work—he pointed his hand directly beneath him and engaged Navani’s fabrial.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As soon as it was activated, he lurched to a halt in the air, hovering—his muscles straining as he was basically doing a handstand with one hand. But as long as the counterweight in the distant shaft was held motionless, Kaladin would be as well.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He gripped the bar across his left hand and began to fall downward, almost as if he were Lashed. In fact, he was counting on it seeming like nothing was wrong with his powers—that he was a full Windrunner ready for battle. He wouldn’t be able to keep up such a facade for long, but perhaps it would gain him an advantage.</p>
<p class="fmtx">His descent—at a speed a notch below insane—gave him a view out the enormous atrium window, running all the way up the wall to his right. Strangely, it was dark outside, though Syl had said it was midday. He didn’t have to ask for clarification, as a flash of lightning bespoke the truth. A highstorm. He still found it incredible that he could be so deep within a tower that one could be going on without him realizing it. Even in the best stormshelters, you usually felt the rumbles of thunder or the anger of the wind.</p>
<p class="fmtx">His fall certainly drew attention. Heavenly Ones dressed in long robes turned from their midair meditations. Shouts rose from Regals or singers along the various levels. He wasn’t certain if Leshwi was among them or not, as he passed too quickly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Using the fabrial, he slowed himself before he hit the ground, then deactivated the device entirely and fell the last five feet or so. Stormlight absorbed that drop, and he startled dozens of people—many of them human—who hadn’t heard the disturbance above. Commerce was now allowed and encouraged by the Fused, and the atrium floor had become a secondary market—though a more transient one than the Breakaway a short distance off. That was where he would find the well.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin’s luminescence would be starkly visible against the dark window, lit in flashes. The shouts of alarm above were swallowed in the voluminous atrium as Kaladin oriented himself, then ran for a stack of crates. He took a few steps up them to launch into the air some ten feet high, then he pointed his left hand and engaged Navani’s device.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He flew like a Windrunner, his body upright, left arm held at chest height, elbow bent. It <i class="calibre6">might</i> look like he was using Lashings. Though Windrunners <span aria-label="806" id="pg_806" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>sometimes dove and flew headfirst like they were swimming, just as often they would fly “standing” up straight—like he did now.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He did tuck his legs up as he went soaring over the heads of the people, who ducked. Syl zipped along beside him, imitating a stormcloud. People cried out, surprised—but also excited—and Kaladin worried about what he was showing them. He didn’t want to inspire a revolt that would get hundreds killed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The best he could hope for was to get in, destroy the fabrial, and get out alive. That goal whispered of a much larger problem. Navani had said there were four nodes. Today, he’d try to destroy the third. At this rate, the last one would fall in a few days, and then what?</p>
<p class="fmtx">He pushed that thought out of his mind as he flew along the top of a corridor, inches from the textured stone ceiling. He didn’t have time for second-guessing, or for dwelling on the crippling darkness and anxiety that continued to scratch at his mind. He had to ignore that, then deal with the effects later. Exactly as he’d been doing far too long now.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Watch for an ambush,” he told Syl as they burst from the corridor and into the Breakaway market. This large room, truly cavernous, was four stories high and packed with shops along the ground. Many were along roadways that Navani—reluctantly adapting to the will of the people—had laid out in the way they wanted. Other parts were snarls of tents and semipermanent wooden structures.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Central to the layout was the enormous well. Kaladin wasn’t high enough to see over the buildings and make it out, but he knew the location. The Edgedancer clinic was nearby, though it was now staffed by ordinary surgeons. He hoped his parents and little brother had made it safely there, where the other surgeons would hide them. They’d checked a few days back and found his father’s clinic empty.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Storms. If he lost his family …</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The Pursuer!” Syl said. “He was waiting by the other entrance.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin reacted just in time, deactivating the fabrial and dropping to the ground, where he tucked and rolled. The relentless Fused appeared from his ribbon of light and dropped to the ground too, but Kaladin rolled to his feet out of the creature’s reach.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your death,” the creature growled, crouched among terrified marketgoers, “is growing tedious, Windrunner. How is it you recovered all of your Lashings?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin launched himself into the air, activating the device and shooting upward. It jerked his arm painfully, but he’d grown used to that—and Stormlight worked to heal the soreness. He’d also practiced his old one-handed spear grips. Hopefully that training would serve him today.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He wasn’t nearly as maneuverable with this device as he was with Lash<span aria-label="807" id="pg_807" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>ings. Indeed, as the Pursuer gave chase as a ribbon, Kaladin’s only real recourse was to cut the device and drop past him. Near the ground, Kaladin pointed his hand to the side and reengaged the device, then went shooting out across the crowd in the general direction of the well. Maybe—</p>
<p class="fmtx">He lurched to a stop as the first of the device’s weights bottomed out. A heartbeat later the Pursuer slammed into him, grabbing him around the neck and hanging on.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Kaladin!” Syl shouted. “Heavenly Ones! Over a dozen of them! They’re streaming in through the tunnels.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Good,” Kaladin said with a grunt, dropping his spear and grappling against the Pursuer with the hand he could move.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“<i class="calibre6">Good?</i>” she asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He couldn’t both grapple and twist the dial on his fabrial—the one that would activate the second weight. But he <i class="calibre6">could</i> deactivate the device using one hand, so he did that, dropping them ten feet to the ground. The Pursuer hit first with a grunt. He hung on though, rolling Kaladin to try to pin him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Turn … the dial,” Kaladin said to Syl, using both hands to struggle with the Pursuer.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“When you die,” the creature said in his ear, “I will find the next Radiant your spren bonds and kill <i class="calibre6">them</i> too. As payment for the trouble you have given me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl zipped down to his left wrist and took the shape of an eel, pushing against the raised section at the center of the dial. She could turn a page, lift a leaf. Would she be strong enough to—</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Click.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin twisted in the Pursuer’s grip, barely managing to press his left hand to the creature’s armored chest. Activating the device sent them both moving upward—but slowly. Storms, Kaladin hadn’t thought this through. He’d only be able to lift as much as the counterweight. Apparently he and the Pursuer together were about that heavy.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Fortunately, rather than taking advantage of the slow movement, the Pursuer paused and glanced at Kaladin’s hand, trying to figure out what was happening. So, as they inched upward, Kaladin was able to rip his right hand free. He reached for the scalpel he’d affixed in a makeshift sheath at his belt, then brought it up and rammed it into the Pursuer’s wrist, slicing the tendons there.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The creature immediately let go, vanishing, leaving a husk behind. Once that dropped off of Kaladin, he immediately went darting up into the sky, pulled by his hand in an awkward motion that nearly ripped his arm from its socket.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This … isn’t that effective, is it?” Syl asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="808" id="pg_808" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“No,” Kaladin said, slowing himself by relaxing his grip. He went to draw in more Stormlight, but realized he still had plenty raging in his veins. That was one advantage of the fabrial; he didn’t use up Light nearly as quickly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Heavenly Ones circled him in the air, but kept their distance. Kaladin searched for the Pursuer—the creature had used two bodies. He had a third one to waste before the fight became dangerous for him, so he wouldn’t retreat yet.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">There,</i> Kaladin thought, noting the red ribbon weaving between Heavenly Ones. The motions looked timid, uncommitted, and Kaladin took a moment to figure out why. The Pursuer was trying to delay Kaladin; each moment wasted was another one that might lead to the Sibling being corrupted.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Below, the market streets were quickly emptying of people. Kaladin’s fears about them revolting weren’t being realized, fortunately—but he couldn’t spend forever in a standoff with the Pursuer. So he disengaged the device and started falling.</p>
<p class="fmtx">This finally made the Pursuer dart for him, and Kaladin quickly reengaged the device—lurching to a halt. He twisted—though he couldn’t move his left arm—and prepared his knife. This sudden motion made the Pursuer back off, however. Could the creature … be afraid? That seemed implausible.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin didn’t have time to reflect, as he needed to engage the Pursuer a third time for his plan to work. So he turned away, inviting the attack—and receiving it as the Pursuer committed, darting in and forming a body that grabbed for Kaladin. Despite trying to speed away, Kaladin wasn’t quite able to evade the creature’s grip.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin was forced to let the Pursuer grab him around the neck as he stabbed the creature in the arm between two plates of carapace, trying to sever the tendons. The monster grunted, his arm around Kaladin’s throat. They continued to soar about thirty feet off the ground. Kaladin ignored the tight grip and maneuvered the scalpel. Perhaps if he could force the Pursuer to waste Voidlight healing …</p>
<p class="fmtx">Yes. Cut enough times to be worried, the Pursuer let go and flew away, seeking a place to recover. Panting, Kaladin used the device to drop to the ground. He landed on an empty street between two tents. People huddled inside both, crowding them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin forced himself to jog to where he’d dropped his spear. Heavenly Ones circled above, preparing to attack. Syl moved up beside him, watching them. Two dozen now. Kaladin searched them, hoping …</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">There.</i> He raised his spear toward Leshwi, who hovered apart from the <span aria-label="809" id="pg_809" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>others, wearing clothing too long for practical battle—even in the air. This event had caught her unaware.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Please,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre6">Accept the fight.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">That was his best hope. He couldn’t fight them all at once; he could barely face the Pursuer. If he wanted any chance of getting to the node, he’d need to fight a single opponent—one who wasn’t as relentless as the Pursuer.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He worried he’d already wasted too much time. But if he could get Leshwi to agree to a duel …</p>
<p class="fmtx">She raised her spear toward him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Syl,” he said, “go to the well and find the fabrial of the node. It’s probably a sapphire, and should have a glass sphere nearby like the one we saw before.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Right,” she said. “It will probably be underwater. That’s what the Sibling said. Near the pump mechanisms. Can … can you swim?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Won’t need to, with Stormlight to sustain me and the fabrial to move me,” Kaladin said, lifting his hand and rising into the air above the market. “But the well is likely under heavy guard. Our best chance to destroy the fabrial will be for me to break from this fight and fly straight down to it, then hit the device in one blow before anyone realizes what I’m doing. I’ll need you to guide me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Sounds good.” She hesitated, looking toward him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ll be all right,” he promised.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She flew off to do as he requested. He might be too late already. He could feel something changing. A greater oppression, a heaviness, was settling upon him. He could only assume it was the result of the Fused corrupting the Sibling.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Well, he couldn’t move in that direction until Syl had the way prepared for him, so this would have to do. He leveled out in the air opposite Leshwi, his hand still held upward above him. The pose made him look overly dramatic, but he tried to appear confident anyway.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Leshwi wore the same body as last time, muscular, tall, wrapped in flowing black and white clothing. Her lance was shorter than normal, perhaps intended for indoor fighting.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Right. Well, he hoped to give a good showing in this fight, long enough to give Syl time to scout for him. So he cut the fabrial and dropped in the air, spinning and giving himself a few seconds of free fall. He felt almost like a real Windrunner—which was dangerous, as he almost tried to sculpt his fall with his hands in the wind. Fortunately, he remembered to engage the device as he neared the rooftops.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He lurched to a stop with a painful <i class="calibre6">jolt,</i> his arm bent, his elbow held close to his side. He had the most stability this way, his muscles keeping <span aria-label="810" id="pg_810" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>him as if he were standing upright with his left arm tucked in to keep his center of gravity close and tight.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He gripped the device’s bar and his left hand tugged him forward, zooming over the roofs of the shops. It made for a pitiful approximation of a true Windrunner maneuver, but Leshwi dove after him anyway, echoing their previous contests.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eyes watering from the pain in his arm, Kaladin dropped to a rooftop and spun to raise his spear toward Leshwi, gripping it firmly in his right hand—a classic formation grip, with the spear up beside his head. <i class="calibre6">Heal!</i> he thought at his arm as Leshwi slowed above, holding her lance in one hand and hovering.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She was plainly cautious, so Kaladin infused a patch of the rooftop with a Reverse Lashing, picturing it pulling on tassels of clothing. Leshwi’s robes rippled and were pulled toward Kaladin, but she took a knife from her belt and cut them, dropping her train and much of the excess clothing to flutter down to affix itself to the rooftop.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin raised himself into the air again, wincing at the pain in his shoulder.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What is wrong, Windrunner?” Leshwi asked in heavily accented Alethi, coming closer. “Your powers fail you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Fight me anyway,” Kaladin called up at her. As he did, he caught a glimpse of the Pursuer’s bloodred ribbon weaving out of a building below.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Leshwi followed his gaze and seemed to understand, for she raised her lance toward him in an attack posture. Kaladin took a deep breath and returned his spear to the overhand grip, weapon up by his head, his elbow cocked. He’d been trained in this grip for shield and spear combat. It was best with a group of friends each with shields up—but what combat wasn’t?</p>
<p class="fmtx">He waited for her to get close, then stabbed at her, causing her to dodge away. The Pursuer’s ribbon fluttered around nearby, weaving between watching Heavenly Ones.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Leshwi made a few more token attempts to engage him, and for a moment the fight seemed almost fair. Then Leshwi rose into the air and passed overhead, while Kaladin was left to twist—then disengage his device and drop a few feet before lurching into a hanging position, facing her. She cocked her head, then flew to the side and attacked him from that direction.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He tried to deflect, but he was too immobile. Her spear bit him in the left arm, causing him to grunt in pain. Blood spread from the wound, and—as before—it didn’t heal immediately. In fact, his Stormlight seemed to be responding slower than it had earlier in this fight.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Storms, this had been a mistake. He couldn’t duel Leshwi like this. He’d be better off on the ground; he’d be outmatched against opponents <span aria-label="811" id="pg_811" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>with the high ground, but at least he wouldn’t be frozen in place. If Navani ever wanted these devices to be useful in aerial combat, she had a lot of work to do.</p>
<p class="fmtx">So he fled, engaging the device and sending himself flying between a couple of Heavenly Ones who moved dutifully to the sides to let Leshwi follow. Even the Pursuer seemed to respect the duel, as his ribbon stopped following and vanished below.</p>
<p class="fmtx">At least that part of Kaladin’s plan had worked. Unfortunately, Leshwi had clearly put together that he couldn’t veer to either side—and that his acceleration was limited to a single Lashing, the maximum from one falling weight. So while he crossed the vast room in seconds, the moment he slowed to prevent himself from hitting the wall, she slammed into him from behind. The force of the hit made him grip the speed-control bar by accident, and he was rammed into the wall by his own fist, Leshwi pressing him from behind.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She put a knife to his neck. “This is a sham, Stormblessed,” she said in his ear. “This is no contest.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He squeezed his eyes shut, fighting off the pain of the hit and the cut to his arm—though that finally appeared to be healing. Slowly, but at least it was happening.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We could drop to the ground,” he said through gritted teeth. “Fight a duel without Surges.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Would you actually do that?” Leshwi said. “I think you cannot spare the time. You’re here to interfere with whatever the Lady of Wishes is doing.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin grunted his reply, not wanting to waste Stormlight by speaking.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Leshwi, however, pulled away in the air, leaving him to turn around awkwardly as he’d done before, with a dropping lurch. She drifted down to eye level with him. Past her, he spotted Syl rising into the air and coming toward him. She made a quick glyph in the air. <i class="calibre6">Ready.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">As Leshwi started talking, he fixed his attention on her so she wouldn’t think anything was amiss.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Surrender,” she said. “If you give your weapon to me now, I might be able to get the Lady of Wishes to turn aside the Pursuer. Together we could start to work toward a true government and peace for Roshar.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A true government and peace?” Kaladin demanded. “Your people are in the middle of <i class="calibre6">conquering</i> mine!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And did your leader not conquer his way to the throne?” she asked, sounding genuinely confused. “This is the way of your people as well as mine. Besides, you must admit my people govern better. The humans under our control have not been treated unfairly. Certainly they live better than the singers fared under your domination.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="812" id="pg_812" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“And your god?” Kaladin asked. “You can promise me that once humankind has been subdued, he won’t have us exterminated?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Leshwi didn’t respond, though she hummed to a rhythm he couldn’t distinguish.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I know the kind of men who follow Odium,” Kaladin said softly. “I’ve known them all my life. I bear their brands on my forehead, Leshwi. I could almost trust you for the honor you’ve shown me—if it didn’t mean trusting him as well.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She nodded, and seemed to accept this as a valid argument. She began lowering, perhaps to engage in that fight he’d suggested, without powers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Leshwi,” he called after she had lowered partway. “I feel the need to point out that I didn’t <i class="calibre6">agree</i> to fight you below. I simply noted it was an option.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What is the distinction?” she called up.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’d rather you not see this as a broken oath,” he said, then disengaged the fabrial and pointed it right at Syl before launching himself that direction—straight over Leshwi’s head.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He didn’t wait to see if she gave chase. Syl streaked ahead of him, leading him straight across the room toward the blue pool of water at the center. Guards were there, pushing people into buildings, but the way was open. The other Heavenly Ones kept their distance from him, assuming he was still dueling with Leshwi.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He cut the fabrial right as he passed over the well, then pointed his hand down and engaged it. His aim was true, and he sucked in more Stormlight as he splashed into the water. It <i class="calibre6">hurt</i> to hit, far more than he’d expected from something soft like water. His arm kept pulling him downward though, despite the resistance.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It quickly grew dark, and a part of him panicked at never having been this far beneath water before. His ears reacted oddly, painfully. Fortunately, his Stormlight sustained him in the chill depth. It also gave him light to see a figure below, swimming beside a group of glowing gemstones on the wall, secured here deep beneath the surface.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The figure turned toward him, her topknot swirling in the water—lit from the side by a variety of gemstone hues. It was her, the one who had been so fascinated with him last time. This time she seemed surprised, drawing a dagger from her belt and swinging it at him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">However, Kaladin found that Navani’s fabrial worked far better in this environment. He could easily disengage it and swing it in another direction without dropping or lurching—and the added pull meant he easily outmaneuvered this Fused.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He spun around her and moved lower in the water. The well’s shaft was <span aria-label="813" id="pg_813" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>only about ten feet wide, so when she pushed off a wall, she could reach him—but behind her, Syl highlighted the correct gemstone.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He engaged his own fabrial, which towed him past the Fused, letting her get a clean cut across his chest with her dagger. Blood clouded the water, but Kaladin connected his fist against the sapphire, knocking it free. He spun his spear in the water and jabbed it at the wires of the fabrial cage, then pried loose the glass sphere. That should do it.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Now to get out. He looked upward through the red water, and began to feel dizzy. Healing was coming so slowly.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Syl soared ahead of him as he used the fabrial to rise up, leaving the annoyed Fused behind. Syl’s light was encouraging, as it seemed to be getting darker in here.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">My Stormlight is running out.</i> Storms. How was he going to get away? Dozens of Fused awaited him above. He … he might have to surrender, as Leshwi had insisted. Would they let him, now?</p>
<p class="fmtx">What was that rumbling? He saw light shimmering above, but it was <i class="calibre6">shrinking.</i> Syl made it out, but she didn’t seem to have realized he was lagging behind her. And the light was vanishing.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">A lid,</i> he realized with panic. <i class="calibre6">They’re putting a lid over the top of the well.</i> As he neared, in the last sliver of light he saw the hulking form of the Pursuer. Smiling.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The lid thumped in place right before Kaladin arrived. He burst into the small section of air between the top of the well’s water level and the lid, gasping for breath.</p>
<p class="fmtx">But he was trapped. He slammed against the wood, trying to use the power of Navani’s device to lift it—but he heard thumping as weights, likely stones, were set on top of it. More and more of them.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Pursuer had been ready for this. He knew that even if Kaladin’s gravitational Lashings worked, enough weight would keep the lid in place. In fact, it felt like the weights were alive. People, dozens of them, climbing on top of the lid. Of course. Why use stone when humans were heavy enough and far easier to move?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin pounded on the wood as he felt Syl panicking, unable to reach him. His Stormlight was fading, and it seemed the walls and the lid were closing in on him. He’d die in here, and it wouldn’t take long. All the Pursuer had to do was wait. They could seal it above, denying him fresh air.…</p>
<p class="fmtx">In that moment of pure terror, Kaladin was in one of his nightmares again.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Blackness.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Encircled by hateful shadows.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Trapped.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="814" id="pg_814" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Anxiety mounted inside him, and he began to thrash in the water, screaming, letting out the rest of his Stormlight. In that moment of panic, he didn’t care. But as he fell hoarse from shouting, he heard—strangely enough—Hav’s voice. Kaladin’s old sergeant, from his days as a recruit.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Panic on the battlefield kills more men than enemy spears. Never run. Always retreat.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">This water came from somewhere. There was another way out.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kaladin took a deep breath and dove beneath the black water, feeling it surround him. His panic returned. He didn’t know which way was up and which was down. How could you forget which way the <i class="calibre6">sky</i> was? But all was blackness. He fished in his pouch, finally managing to think clearly. He got out a glowing gemstone, but it slipped from his fingers.</p>
<p class="fmtx">And sank.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">That way.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">He pointed his fist toward the falling light and engaged Navani’s device. He was in no state for delicacy, so he squeezed as tight as he could and lurched, towed by his arm farther into the darkness. He plunged past the fabrials and the Fused—she was swimming upward, and didn’t seem concerned with him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">His ears screamed with a strange pain the deeper he went. He started to breathe in more Stormlight, but stopped himself. Underwater, he risked getting a lungful of liquid. But … he had no idea how to get Light when submerged. How had they never thought about this?</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was good that the device kept pulling him, because he might not have had the presence of mind to keep moving on his own. That was proven as he reached the gemstone he’d dropped, a garnet, and found it sitting on the bottom of the tube. A bright sapphire glowed here too, the one he’d knocked free. He grabbed it and disengaged the gauntlet fabrial, but it took him precious seconds to think and search around.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The tunnel turned level here. He moved in that direction, engaging the device, letting it pull him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">His lungs started to burn. He was still surviving on the breath he’d taken above, and didn’t know how to get more Stormlight. He was still trailing blood as well.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Was that light ahead, or was his vision getting so bad that he was seeing stars?</p>
<p class="fmtx">He chose to believe it was light. When he reached it—more fabrial pumps—he shut off his fabrial, pointed his hand upward, and engaged the device again. Nightmares chased him, manifestations of his anxiety, and it was as if the world were crushing him. Everything became blackness once more.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="815" id="pg_815" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The only thing he felt was Syl, so distant now, terrified. He thought that would be his last sensation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Then he broke out of the water into the air. He gasped—a raw and primal action. A physiological response rather than conscious choice. Indeed, he must have blacked out anyway, for when he blinked and his senses returned, he found himself hanging by his aching arm from the ceiling in a reservoir beneath the tower.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He shook his head, and looked at his hand. He’d dropped the sapphire, and when he tried to breathe in Stormlight, nothing came. His pouch was empty of it. He must have fed off it while drifting in and out of consciousness. He was tempted to let himself sleep again.…</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No! They’ll be coming for you!</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">He forced his eyes open. If the enemy had explored the tower enough to know about this reservoir, they would come looking to be certain he was dead.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He disengaged the fabrial and dropped into the water. The cold shocked him awake, and he was able to use the fabrial to tug himself to the side of the reservoir. He crawled out onto dry stone. Amusingly, he was enough a surgeon to worry about how he’d contaminated this drinking water. Of all the things to think about right now …</p>
<p class="fmtx">He wanted to sleep, but could see blood dripping from his chest and arm, the wounds there not fully healed. So he stumbled to the side of the chamber and sucked the Stormlight from the two lamps there. Yes, the enemy knew about this place. If he hadn’t been so addled, he’d have put together earlier that the light meant someone was changing the gemstones.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He stumbled, sodden and exhausted, down the hallway. There would be an exit. He vaguely remembered news of Navani’s scouts finding this reservoir. They’d only known about it by having Thaylen free divers inspect the fabrials in the well.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Keep thinking. Keep walking. Don’t drift off.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Where was Syl? How far was he from her now? He’d traveled quite a way in the darkness of that water.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He reached steps, but couldn’t force himself to climb them. He just stood, numb, staring at them. So he used the fabrial. Slow, easy climbs with it tugging him up at one angle, then another. Back and forth. Again and again.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He knew he was close when he heard rumbling. The highstorm. It was still blowing, so he hadn’t been in that blackness for an eternity. He let it call to him as he continued half-flying, half-trudging upward.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Finally he staggered out of a room on the ground floor of the tower. He emerged right into the middle of a group of singer troops shouting for people to go to their quarters.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="816" id="pg_816" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>The storm rumbled in the near distance. Several of the soldiers turned toward him. Kaladin had a moment of profound disconnect, as if he couldn’t believe he was still alive. As if he’d thought that trudge up the stairwell had been his climb to the Tranquiline Halls.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Then one of the guards leveled a spear at him, and Kaladin’s body knew what to do. Exhausted, wounded, nerves worn all the way to Damnation, Kaladin grabbed that spear and twisted it out of the man’s hands, then swept the legs of the next soldier.</p>
<p class="fmtx">A few Regals not far off shouted, and he caught sight of a Heavenly One—not Leshwi—rising into the air and pointing a lance at him. They weren’t through with him yet.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He turned and ran, holding that stolen spear, drawing in Stormlight from lanterns—but feeling it do nothing at all to heal him. Even the slow healing from before had apparently stopped working. Either he’d further undermined his powers somehow by destroying the fabrial, or—more likely—the Sibling was too far gone toward corruption.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Chased by dozens of soldiers, Kaladin ran for the storm. Though it was dangerous outside, at least the enemy would have difficulty finding him in the tempest. He couldn’t fight them—the only way to escape was to do something truly desperate.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He reached the front entryway of the tower, where winds coursed in through a portal that might once have held a wooden gate. They’d never taken the time to put in a new one. Why would they? The storms rarely reached this high.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Today they had.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Today, Kaladin reached the winds.</p>
<p class="fmtx">And like everything else today, they tried their best to kill him.</p>
