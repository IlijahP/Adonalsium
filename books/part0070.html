Cultivationspren seem to be composed of living vines that interweave in subtle patterns, like finely woven cloth whose weave is nearly invisible to human eyes. They often act as traders and merchants in Shadesmar, and as such they maintain relations with almost every group of spren, even those who are normally hostile to each other. Their hands, eyes, and teeth appear to be made of perfect crystal, clear yet filled with reflections of light. Their hands are as flexible and mobile as flesh, but their teeth appear firm as bone. In the Physical Realm, they most often appear as a rippling river of vines and crystals that sprout, weave, and shatter into dust within moments as they move sinuously across a surface. Sometimes they appear with an expressive, humanlike face that resembles the one they bear in the Cognitive Realm." class="img1" id="fig11" src="../images/00040.jpeg" title="Shallan’s Sketchbook: Cultivationspren.
