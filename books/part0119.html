Inkspren weapons may or may not be sheathed, and sometimes hang in the air at their sides or backs, not needing to be attached physically to remain with them. They do not wear armor. Instead, the armor is a part of their forma and sometimes defies human concepts of anatomy. It reminds me less of steel and more of shell or carapace. Each surface has an iridescent sheen, a rainbow shimmer that moves independently of the surrounding lights. In the Physical Realm, inkspren can change their size, but not their shape. They can be as large as a human, or as small as a speck of dust, but they will always look like themselves." class="img1" id="fig16" src="../images/00029.jpeg" title="Shallan’s Sketchbook: Inkspren.
