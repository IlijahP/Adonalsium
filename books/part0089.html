<p class="tni">Eshonai found the humans endlessly fascinating.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Between their first and second visits, Eshonai had organized several trips to try to find their homeland. Suddenly, everyone had wanted to join her, and she’d led large expeditions. Those had been all song, and no crescendo, unfortunately—the only thing she’d been able to locate was a solitary human outpost to the west.</p>
<p class="fmtx">They’d told her to expect a second visit soon, but now that visit seemed to be drawing to a close. So Eshonai took every remaining opportunity to watch the humans. She loved the way they walked, the way they talked, even the way they <i class="calibre6">looked</i> at her. Or sometimes didn’t.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Like today, as she strolled through Gavilar Kholin’s camp. His servants barely glanced at her as they packed. She stepped up beside one worker, who was unstringing a large metal bow. The man <i class="calibre6">must</i> have seen her standing there—but when he stood up a few minutes later, he jumped to find her beside him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Such strange behavior. Sometimes she thought she could read the rhythms in the human motions—like that man with the bow would be attuned to Anxiety. Yet they still didn’t seem to grasp that listeners could hear something they could not. What would it be like to go about all the time without a rhythm in your head? It must be painful. Or lonely. So empty.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The various humans continued their packing, storing everything in wagons for the day’s storm. The humans were good at judging the arrival of those—though they were often wrong on the hour, they were usually right on the day. This, however, was no routine pre-storm packing job. <span aria-label="689" id="pg_689" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>They would soon leave; she could read this in the way they talked to each other, the way they double-checked bindings and folded tents with more precision than usual. They weren’t planning to unpack any of it for a while.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She wished they would stay longer—their first interaction had been so short, and now this second visit was over almost before it began. Perhaps she could go with them, as she’d told Venli. She’d asked how far beyond the hills their home was, but they didn’t answer, and refused to share their maps.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai moved to slip out of camp, but stopped as she noticed one man standing off from the rest. Dalinar Kholin looked out, eastward, toward the Origin of Storms.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Curious, Eshonai walked up to him, noting that he had his Shardblade out. He held it lightly before him, the tip sunken into the stone. He seemed to be searching for something, but before him stretched only the Plains—an empty expanse.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Unlike the others, he noticed her approach immediately, turning as she made the slightest scrape on the stones while walking. She froze beneath his gaze, which always seemed to be the stare of a greatshell.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re one of the interpreters,” he said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What was your name?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Eshonai,” she said, though she had little doubt he’d forget again. The humans didn’t seem to be able to distinguish very well between different listeners.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Have you been out there?” he asked, nodding toward the Plains. “To the center?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No,” she said. “I’d like to go, but the old bridges … they do not stand. It would take work, much work, to put them back. Most of my people don’t like … what is the word? Going where it is difficult to go?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Exploring, perhaps,” he said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes. Exploring. We once exploring. But now, very little exploring.” <i class="calibre6">Until recently.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">He grunted. “You’re good with our language.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I like it,” she said. “Speaking new ways. Thinking new ways. They are same, yes?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, perhaps they are.” He turned and looked over his shoulder toward the west. Toward his homeland. “Perhaps your people are afraid to return to where they once lived.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Why fear that?” Eshonai asked, attuning Confusion.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Places have power over us, parshwoman,” he said. “Places have memories. Sometimes when you go to a place you’ve never been, it can be wonderful … because it lets you be someone else. No expectations. No storming memories.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="690" id="pg_690" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I like new places,” she said. “Because … they are new.” She attuned Irritation. That hadn’t come out as she’d wanted it to; she felt stupid, speaking their language. It was difficult to express anything deep while speaking it, because the rhythms didn’t match the sounds.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Wise words,” Dalinar said.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Wise words?</i> Was he being patronizing? Humans seemed to not expect much from her people, and were surprised whenever a complex conversation happened. As if they were amused that the listeners were not as dull-minded as parshmen.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I would like to go to see places where you live,” Eshonai said. “I would visit you, and have you visit us, more.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar dismissed his Blade, sending it away with a puff of white fog. She attuned Confusion.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My brother has taken an interest in you,” Dalinar said softly. “This … Well, be more cautious with your invitations, parshwoman. Our attention can be dangerous.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I do not understand,” she said. It sounded as if he were warning her against his own.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have grown tired of pushing people around,” Dalinar said. “In my wake, I’ve left too many smoldering holes where cities used to be. You are something special, something we’ve never seen before. And I know my brother—I know that look in his eyes, that excitement.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“His interest could benefit you, but it could have an equal cost. Do not be so quick to share your stormshelter with men you just barely met. Don’t offend, but also don’t be too quick to bend. Any new recruit needs to learn both lessons. In this case, I’d suggest politeness—but care. Do not let him back you into a corner. He will respect you if you stand up for yourselves. And whatever you do, <i class="calibre6">don’t</i> give him any reason to decide he wants what you have.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Be forceful, stand up for themselves, but don’t offend their king? How did that make any sense? Yet looking at him—listening to his calm but firm voice—she thought she did understand. His intent, as if given to her by a rhythm.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Be careful with us</i> was what he was saying. <i class="calibre6">We are far more dangerous than you think.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">He had mentioned … burning cities.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How many cities do your people live in?” she asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Hundreds,” he said. “The number of humans in our realm would stagger you. It is many times the number of parshmen I’ve seen here living with you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Impossible. That … was impossible, wasn’t it?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">We know so little.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="691" id="pg_691" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Thank you,” she said to Appreciation. She got it to click, the way of speaking his language but putting a rhythm to it. It <i class="calibre6">could</i> work.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He nodded to her. “We are leaving. I realize this visit was short, but my brother needs to return to his lands. You will … certainly meet us again. We will send a more permanent envoy. I promise you this.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He turned, moving with the momentum of a shifting boulder, and walked toward his stormwagon.</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Venli felt as if the bright red gemstone would burn its way through her clothing. She huddled in one of the stormshelters: a group of wide slits in the ground near the city, which they’d covered over with animal carapace and crem. Each was in the top of a hill, so the sides could drain.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli’s immediate family gathered together in this one to chat and feast, as was their habit during storm days. The others seemed so cheerful, speaking to Joy or Appreciation while they ate beside the fire, listening as Venli’s mother sang songs by the light of uncut gemhearts.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Those could be organic, lumpish things. While they took in Stormlight, none were nearly as bright as the strange gemstone in her pocket. The one the human had given her. Venli felt as if it should be on fire, though it was as cold as a normal gemstone. She attuned Anxiety and glanced at the others, worrying they’d see that too-red glow.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">I’m supposed to go out into the storm,</i> she thought, listening to the rain pound distant stone. <i class="calibre6">Does this count? I can see the storm out there, flashing and making its own rhythm, too frantic. Too wild.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">No, she wasn’t close enough. Hiding in one of these shelters wouldn’t allow her to adopt mateform, which was the sole transformation they did regularly. No one wanted to go back to dullform, after all.</p>
<p class="fmtx">There <i class="calibre6">were</i> other forms to be found. She’d been close to warform. And now … this gemstone …</p>
<p class="fmtx">She’d carried it for weeks, terrified of what might happen. She glanced at her mother, and the close family members who sat and listened. Enraptured by the beautiful songs. Even Venli, who had heard them hundreds of times, found herself wanting to drift back and sit at her mother’s feet.</p>
<p class="fmtx">None of them knew what was happening. To Jaxlim. Mother hid it well. Was it true, that other forms could help her? The humans were leaving now, so this was the last chance Venli would have to try the gemstone, then—if it didn’t work—get answers from the human who had given it to her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli attuned Determination and rose from her place, walking toward the end of the shelter, where they’d tied their gemstones to be renewed—close <span aria-label="692" id="pg_692" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>enough to the storm to be given light by the Rider’s touch. Several of the others whispered behind her, their voices attuned to Amusement. They thought she had decided to adopt mateform, which she’d always been adamant she would never do.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Her mother had smiled when she’d asked, explaining that few ever <i class="calibre6">intended</i> to adopt mateform. She acted as if it was simply something that happened, that an urge overtook you, or you sat too close to the exit during a storm—then poof, the next thing you knew, you’d become a silly idiot looking to breed. It was embarrassing to think others assumed Venli was doing that now.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She reached the wet stone at the edge of the shelter, where rainspren clustered with eyes pointed upward and grasping claws below. The wind and thunder were louder here, like the war calls of a rival family, trying to frighten her away.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Perhaps it would be best just to give the gemstone to her mother, and let <i class="calibre6">her</i> go try to find the new form. Wasn’t that what this was about?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">No,</i> Venli thought, trembling. <i class="calibre6">No. It’s not.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Months spent trying to find new forms had gotten her nowhere—while Eshonai gained more and more acclaim. Even their mother, who had called her explorations foolish, now spoke of Eshonai with respect. The person who had found the humans. The person who had changed the world.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli had done what she was supposed to. She’d remained with her mother, she’d spent endless days memorizing songs, dutiful. But Eshonai got the praise.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Before her nerves betrayed her, Venli stepped out onto the hillside, entering the storm. The force of the wind made her stumble and slide down the slick rock. In an eyeblink she went from sheltered, song-filled warmth to icy chaos. A tempest with sounds like instruments breaking and songs failing. She tried to hold to the Rhythm of Resolve, but it was the Rhythm of Winds by the time she scrambled behind a large boulder and pressed her back against the stone.</p>
<p class="fmtx">From there, her mind devolved to the Rhythm of Pleading, bordering on panic. What was she doing? This was <i class="calibre6">insanity.</i> She’d often <i class="calibre6">mocked</i> those who went out in the storms without shields or other protections.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She wanted to return to the shelter, but she was too frightened to move. Something large crushed the ground nearby, causing her to jump, but a moment of darkness in the howling tempest prevented her from seeing how close the impact had been. As if the lightning, the wind, and the rain all conspired against her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She reached into her pocket and took out the gemstone. What had seemed so bright before now seemed frail. The red light barely illuminated her hand.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="693" id="pg_693" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Break it. She was supposed to break it. With fingers already numb from the cold, she searched around, eventually finding a large stone. The ground was shattered here in a circle the size of a listener. She retreated to the relative shelter of the boulder, shivering as she held the gemstone in one hand, the rock in the other.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Then silence.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was so sudden, so unexpected, that she gasped. The rhythms in her mind became as one, a single steady beat. She looked upward into pure blackness. The ground around her seemed dry all of a sudden. She slowly turned around, then huddled down again. There was something in the sky, something like a face made from clouds and natural light. The impression of something vast and unknowable.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Y<small class="calibre8">OU WISH TO TAKE THIS STEP</small>? a not-voice said, vibrating through her like a rhythm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I…” This was him, the spren of highstorms—the Rider of Storms. The songs called him a traitor.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Y<small class="calibre8">OU HAVE SPENT SO LONG AS CHILDREN OF NO GOD,</small> the rhythm said to her. Y<small class="calibre8">OU WOULD MAKE THIS CHOICE FOR ALL OF YOUR PEOPLE</small>?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli felt both a thrill and a terror at those words. So there <i class="calibre6">was</i> something in the gemstone?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“My … my people need forms!” she shouted up toward the vast entity.</p>
<p class="fmtx">T<small class="calibre8">HIS IS MORE THAN FORMS.</small> T<small class="calibre8">HIS POWER CHANGES MORTALS.</small></p>
<p class="fmtx">Power?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You served our enemies!” she called to the sky. “How can I trust what you say?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Y<small class="calibre8">ET YOU TRUST THE GIFT OF ONE OF THOSE ENEMIES</small>? R<small class="calibre8">EGARDLESS,</small> I <small class="calibre8">SERVE NO ONE.</small> N<small class="calibre8">OT MAN OR SINGER.</small> I <small class="calibre8">SIMPLY AM.</small> F<small class="calibre8">AREWELL, CHILD OF THE</small> P<small class="calibre8">LAINS.</small></p>
<p class="fmtx">C<small class="calibre8">HILD OF</small> O<small class="calibre8">DIUM.</small></p>
<p class="fmtx">The vision ended as abruptly as it had begun, and Venli was again in the storm. She nearly dropped her burdens in shock, but then—huddling against the gleeful wind—she set the glowing gemstone on the ground. She gripped the rock in her hand, slick with rain. She wavered.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Should she take more care?</p>
<p class="fmtx">What greatness was achieved by being careful, though?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Eshonai hadn’t been careful, and she’d discovered a new world. Venli slammed the stone downward and crushed the gem. Light escaped in a puff, and she winced in the pelting rain, bracing herself for a wondrous transformation.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Finally!” a voice said to the Rhythm of Irritation. “<i class="calibre6">That</i> was unpleasant.” The red light turned into a tiny human male, standing with hands on hips, glowing faintly in the storm.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="694" id="pg_694" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Venli pulled her arms in tight, shivering, blinking rainwater out of her eyes. “Spren,” she hissed. “I have summoned you to grant me one of the ancient forms.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You?” he asked. “How old are you? Are there any others I could talk to?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Show me this secret first,” she said. “Then we will give your form to others. It can heal them, right? That is what I was told.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He didn’t reply.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You will not deny me this!” Venli said, though her words were lost in a sudden peal of thunder. “I’ve suffered long to accomplish this goal.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Well, you’re certainly <i class="calibre6">dramatic,</i>” the little spren said, tapping his foot. “Guess we use the tools we find in the shed, even if they’ve got a little rust on them. Here’s the deal. I’m going to take up residence inside of you, and together we’re going to do some incredible things.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We will bring useful forms to my people?” Venli asked, her teeth chattering.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Well, yes. And also no. For a while, we’ll need you to appear as if you are still in workform. I need to scout out how things are on old Roshar these days. It’s been a while. You think you can get into Shadesmar, if we need to?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Sh-Shadesmar?” she asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, we need to get to the storm there. The newer one in the south? Where I entered that gemstone … You have no idea what I’m talking about. Delightful. Right, then. Get ready, we’ve got <i class="calibre6">a lot</i> of work to do.…”</p>
<p class="sb-std">*   *   *</p>
<p class="tni">Eshonai attuned Anxiety as she stood by the mouth of the shelter, searching for her sister. She couldn’t make out much in the tempest. The flashes of lightning, though brilliant, were too brief to give her a real picture of the landscape.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“She really did it, did she?” Thude asked to Amusement as he stepped up beside her, chewing on some fruit. “After all that complaining, she sauntered out to become a mate.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I doubt it,” Eshonai said. “She’s been trying to find warform for months now. She’s not looking to become a mate. She’s too young, anyway.” The humans had been surprised at how young Eshonai and Venli were—apparently, humans aged more slowly? But Venli was still months away from official adulthood.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Younger ones have made the decision,” Thude said, rubbing at his beard. “I’ve thought about it, you know? There’s a certain bond to once-mates.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="695" id="pg_695" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“You just think it sounds fun,” Eshonai said to Reprimand.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He laughed. “I do at that.” Thunder shook the enclosure, silencing both of them for a time as they listened to it, both attuning the Rhythm of Winds out of deference. There was something wondrous—if dangerous—about feeling the very vibrations of the storm.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This isn’t the time to be distracted by something silly like mateform,” Eshonai said. “The humans are leaving again once this storm ends. We should be talking about sending someone with them.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re too responsible for your own good sometimes, Eshonai,” Thude replied, his arm up against the top of the enclosure as he leaned forward, letting the rain hit his face.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Me? Responsible?” she said. “Mother might have words for you on <i class="calibre6">that</i> topic.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And each one would remind me how alike the two of you are,” Thude said, attuned to Joy and grinning at the storm like a fool. “I’m going to do it one of these days, Eshonai. I’m going to see if Bila will go with me. Life is meant to be more than working the fields or chopping wood.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">With that, Eshonai could agree. And she supposed she could understand someone wanting to do something different with their life. None of them would exist if their parents hadn’t decided to become mates.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The idea still made her want to attune Anxiety. She disliked how much that form changed the way people thought. She wanted to be herself, with her own desires and passions, not let some form override her. Of course, there was an argument that she was even now influenced by workform.…</p>
<p class="fmtx">She attuned Determination and put that out of her mind. Venli. Where was she? Eshonai knew she shouldn’t fear for her sister. Listeners went into the storms all the time, and while it was never strictly safe, she didn’t need to hum to Anxiety like the humans did when they talked of storms. Storms were a natural part of life, a gift from Roshar to the listeners.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Though a little piece of Eshonai … a part she hated to acknowledge … noted how much easier life would be without Venli around, complaining all the time. Without her jealousy. Everything Eshonai did—every conversation, or plan, or outing—was made harder when Venli decided to be involved. Complications would materialize out of calm air.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was weakness in Eshonai that she should feel this way. She was supposed to love her sister. And she didn’t really <i class="calibre6">want</i> harm to come to Venli, but it was difficult not to remember how peaceful it had been to explore on her own, without any of Venli’s drama.…</p>
<p class="fmtx">A figure appeared out of the storm, slick with rain, backlit by lightning. Eshonai felt guilty again, and attuned Joy by force upon seeing it was Venli. She stepped out into the storm and helped her sister the rest of the way.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="696" id="pg_696" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Venli remained in workform. A wet, shivering femalen in workform.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Didn’t work, eh?” Thude asked her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli looked at him, as mute as a human, her mouth opening a little. Then, unnervingly, she grinned. A frantic, uncharacteristic grin.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No, Thude,” Venli said. “It didn’t work. I will have to try many, many more times to find warform.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He hummed to Reconciliation, eyeing Eshonai. She’d been right—it hadn’t been about mateform after all.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I should like to sit by the fire,” Venli said, “and warm myself.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Venli?” Eshonai said. “Your words … where are their rhythms?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Venli paused. Then she—as if it were a struggle—began humming to Amusement. It took her a few tries.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Don’t be silly,” Venli said. “You just weren’t listening.” She strode toward the fire, walking with a swagger that seemed even more confident than normal. The high-headed stroll of a femalen who thought that the storms began and ended upon her whims.</p>
