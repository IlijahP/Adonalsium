<p class="tni">Two days after defeating Taravangian’s traitors, Dalinar stood in the war tent, helping prepare for the larger offensive against the singers in Emul. Just behind him stood Szeth in disguise. Nobody gave the man a second glance; Dalinar often had members of the Cobalt Guard with him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar surveyed the war table with its maps and lists of troop numbers. So many different pieces, representing the state of their fighting across many different battlefronts. When he’d been younger, these types of abstractions had frustrated him. He’d wanted to be <i class="calibre6">on</i> the battlefield, Blade in hand, smashing his way through enemy lines and making such maps obsolete.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Then he’d begun to see the armies behind the little squares on the sheets of paper. Begun to truly grasp how the movement of troops—supplies, logistics, large-scale tactics—was more important than winning a given battle in person. And it had excited him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Somehow he’d moved beyond that now. War—and all its facets—no longer excited him. It was important, and it was a thing he would do. But he had discovered a greater duty.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">How do we win? Truly</i> win, <i class="calibre6">not merely gain an advantage for a time?</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">He mused on these thoughts as his generals and head scribes presented their final conclusions on the Veden betrayal.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="632" id="pg_632" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“Our troops in southern Alethkar were successfully supported by the Thaylen ships, as you advised,” Teshav said. “Our generals along the coast were able to retreat through a series of fortresses as you directed. They have regrouped at Karanak—which we control. Because none of our battalions were completely surrounded by Vedens, we suffered virtually no losses.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Our navy locked the Veden ships into their ports,” said Kmakl, the aging Thaylen prince consort. “They won’t break our blockade anytime soon, unless the Fused and Skybreakers give them heavy air support.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We destroyed almost all the Vedens who betrayed us here,” said Omal, a short Azish general who wore a brightly colored patterned sash across his uniform coat. “Your leadership on the battlefield was excellent, Blackthorn—not to mention the timeliness of your warnings before the battle. Instead of burning our supply dumps and rescuing their king, they were nearly eliminated.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar looked across the table at the Mink, who was smiling with a gap-toothed sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This was very well handled, Uncle,” Jasnah said to him, surveying the war table map. “You averted a catastrophe.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Noura conferred with the Azish emperor, who sat on a throne near the side of the battle tent, then walked over. “We regret the loss of such an important ally in Taravangian,” she said. “This betrayal will be felt—and prosecuted—by the Azish for generations. That said, we too approve of your handling of the situation. You did well to remain suspicious of him all these months, and we were unwise to think his treachery was all in the past.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar leaned over the table, which was lit with spheres. Though he missed the large illusory map he could create with Shallan, there was something about the tangible feeling of <i class="calibre6">this</i> map, the paper marked up with the thoughts of his best generals, that spoke to him. As he stared, everything but the map seemed to fade from his view.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Something was still wrong. Taravangian had been so <i class="calibre6">subtle</i> for so many months. Yet now he let himself be captured?</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">His armies in Jah Keved seem not to care much about him,</i> Dalinar thought, reading the displayed battle reports and figures as if they were whispered explanations in his ears. <i class="calibre6">The Veden highprinces will be happy to put their own men in charge. And they seem quick to side with the singers, as the Iriali were.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">Kharbranth, led by Taravangian’s daughter Savrahalidem, had disavowed their former ruler and proclaimed themselves neutral in the conflict—with their surgeons willing to continue serving whichever side petitioned their aid. Dalinar would have his ships blockade them just in <span aria-label="633" id="pg_633" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>case—but he wasn’t about to land troops there and fight a costly battle for such a relatively unimportant target. They likely knew that.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The real prize was Taravangian himself. Someone Dalinar already held captive. After the elderly king’s careful posturing over the years, how had he let his empire collapse practically overnight?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Why? Why risk it now?</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What news of Urithiru?” Dalinar asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Windrunners should return soon with their latest visual on the tower,” Teshav said from the dim perimeter of the table. “But Brightness Navani’s most recent spanreed letter indicates that our people there are managing well.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Navani continued to send soldiers hiking along the outside of the mountain faces to deliver messages. Each new bit told them a little more. Some of Taravangian’s scholars had activated a device like the one Highmarshal Kaladin had found. A separate collapse of the tunnels below—likely the work of saboteurs—made getting in and out that way impossible.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The device was hidden, and Navani hadn’t been able to find and deactivate it. She worried the search would take weeks. Unfortunately, Dalinar’s scouts had proven the device’s effectiveness. If they drew too close, they not only lost their powers, but dropped unconscious.</p>
<p class="fmtx">For now though, it seemed that everyone was safe—though inconvenienced. If Dalinar hadn’t been anticipating the betrayal, things could have gone very differently. He could imagine a version of events where Taravangian’s betrayal threw the coalition into chaos, allowing the singer military to surge forward and push Dalinar’s troops all the way back to Azimir. There, without proper resupply and support, they could have been crushed.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Perhaps that’s it,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre6">Perhaps that was what Taravangian was intending—why he risked so much.</i> The king, so far, had remained silent during interrogations. Perhaps Dalinar could speak to him directly and get more information. But he worried that somehow all of this was according to Taravangian’s plans, and Dalinar was second-guessing himself at every point.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Monarchs,” Dalinar said to the group, “I suggest we continue our battle for Emul until we have more information about Urithiru.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Agreed,” the Azish emperor said immediately.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will seek approval from the guilds of Thaylenah and the queen,” Prince Kmakl said, scanning through naval reports. “But for now, I have no problem with continuing to let the Alethi generals lead. However, Brightlord Dalinar, you realize this betrayal is going to make recovering your homeland even more difficult.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="634" id="pg_634" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“I do,” Dalinar said. “I still believe that the best thing we can do for Alethkar’s eventual recovery is to first secure the West.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Each of those words was a knife stabbing at his heart. It meant giving Alethkar up for years. Perhaps longer. With Jah Keved as a staging area, he’d been able to entertain dreams of striking right for Kholinar. No longer.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">Storming Taravangian. Damnation take you.</i></p>
<p class="fmtx">With Kmakl and the Azish weighing in, the sole monarch who hadn’t spoken up was Jasnah. She inspected the maps, Wit—as ever—standing at her shoulder.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I assume, Uncle,” she said, “that you will be letting the Mink prosecute this campaign?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This is a larger conflict than one man can direct on his own,” Dalinar said. “But after his handling of the battle two days ago, I think he’s proven his worth. One of the reasons I worked so hard to recruit him was to have his particular genius directing our strategy.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“At the will of the monarchs,” the Mink said, “I’ll do this—but remember your promises. I won’t have you escape them. Once we inevitably liberate Alethkar, my kingdom is next.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah nodded. “I would like to see your battle plans, General Dieno. I give my initial approval to our continued offensive into Emul, but I will want details. Losing access to the Oathgates is going to prove disruptive.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">With that, Dalinar called an end to the meeting. People began to uncover spheres around the perimeter of the war pavilion—revealing how enormous it truly was. It had to be large enough to accommodate everyone’s entourages, and so the map table looked small once everyone started retreating to their sections of the tent.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kmakl made his way over to the Thaylen scribes, where they used spanreeds to send minutes of the meeting home to Fen and the Thaylen guildmasters. Dalinar shook his head. He agreed with Fen’s decision to stay behind, and wished that Jasnah had made the same choice. Too many monarchs in one location made him nervous.</p>
<p class="fmtx">It also bothered him that so much of what Queen Fen did was subject to the whims of a bunch of merchants and guildmasters. If they did win this war, he’d see if he could find a way to help her wrest control of her kingdom from those eels.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Azish and Emuli contingents began to vacate the war tent, letting in some fresh air. Dalinar used a handkerchief to mop at the sweat on the back of his neck—this region of Roshar wasn’t as muggy as the parts around the Reshi Isles, but the summer weather here was still too hot for his taste. He almost wanted to have one of the Windrunners fly him up to a higher altitude where he could get some proper cold air and think clearly.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="635" id="pg_635" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>He settled for stepping outside the tent and surveying the camp. They’d commandeered a small town named Laqqi, just inside the Emuli border, not too far from Azimir. That placed it about a three-day march from the battlefront, where their lines—soon to be reinforced—held against the enemy forces to the south.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Little more than a village, Laqqi had been overrun by troops setting up supply stations and command tents. Workers reinforced the eastern approach to block storms, and Windrunners soared through the air. This position made for an excellent command center, close enough to the battlefront to be reached by short flight, but far enough away to be protected from ground assault.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar took some time out here, after checking that little Gav was playing happily with his governess, to think about Evi. Storms, he’d been so proud at Adolin’s birth. How had he let himself miss so much of his son’s childhood?</p>
<p class="fmtx">He turned those memories over in his head. At first, he’d found being able to remember Evi to be novel—but the more the memories settled with him, the more they felt comfortable, like a familiar seat by the fire. He was ashamed of so much of what he’d remembered about himself, but he would not trade these memories again. He needed them. Needed her.</p>
<p class="fmtx">He enjoyed the fresh air for a time, breathing deeply, before he returned to the tent to get something to drink. Szeth followed with his hand on his oversized sword—the silver sheath and black hilt were masked by a disguise. Szeth didn’t say anything, but Dalinar knew that he considered his defeat by Nale to be shameful. In Dalinar’s estimation, it spoke more of the Herald’s skill than anything else. Why was it Nale so often stayed out of battles, overseeing his Skybreakers from afar?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah joined Dalinar as he poured himself some wine in the tent, by the bar. She knew what Szeth really was, but she was too politic to give him so much as a glance.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You’re stepping away from the fight, Uncle,” she noted quietly. “I expected you to lead the war effort here personally.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I have found someone more capable to do the job.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Pardon, Uncle, but you should find a better lie. You <i class="calibre6">never</i> let go of something you’re interested in doing yourself. It’s one of your more consistent behaviors.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He stilled himself, then glanced about the room. She shouldn’t have confronted him here, where representatives of the other monarchs might hear. Knowing Jasnah, that was part of the reason she had done so. With her, every conversation was a little contest, and she always considered the terrain.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’m beginning to realize something,” he said softly, stepping her over to <span aria-label="636" id="pg_636" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>the side, away from the bar. Szeth stayed close, as did Wit. Others gave them space. “My powers as a Bondsmith are more valuable than we have known. I told you about how, in the battle, I touched Nalan and saw his past.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A feat you’ve been unable to replicate with Shalash or Talenelat.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, because I don’t know what I’m doing!” Dalinar said. “I am a weapon we haven’t fully investigated. I need to learn how to use these powers—use them for more than merely renewing spheres and opening the perpendicularity.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I appreciate someone wanting to learn, Uncle,” Jasnah said. “But you are <i class="calibre6">already</i> a powerful weapon. You are one of our greatest military minds.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I need to become something more,” Dalinar said. “I’m worried that this war is going to be an endless give-and-take. We seize Emul, but lose Jah Keved. Back and forth, back and forth. How do we <i class="calibre6">win,</i> Jasnah? What is our end goal?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She nodded slowly. “We need to push Odium to an accord. You think learning about your powers can help you achieve this?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Over a year had passed since Odium had agreed to a contest by champions—but since then, Dalinar hadn’t seen the being. No visits. No visions. Not even a messenger.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Rayse—Odium—is not one to be pushed into anything,” Wit said from over Jasnah’s shoulder. “He might have agreed to a contest in theory, Blackthorn, but he never set terms. And he won’t, as long as he thinks he’s winning this war. You need to frighten him, convince him that he might lose. Only then will he proceed with a contest of champions—as long as the terms limit his losses.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I would rather a complete victory than something that allows Odium to hedge his bets,” Dalinar said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ah, delightful,” Wit replied, holding up his palm and mimicking writing something down. “I’ll just make a note that you’d like to win. Yes, how <i class="calibre6">foolish</i> of me not to realize that, Blackthorn. Total victory. Over a god. Who is currently holding your homeland, and recently gained the allegiance of one of the strongest militaries on the planet. Shall I also have him bake you something sweet as an apology for this whole ‘end of the world’ mess?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That will do, Wit,” Dalinar said with a sigh.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The baking thing is an actual tradition,” Wit added. “I once visited a place where—if you lose a battle—your mother has to bake the other fellow something tasty. I rather liked those people.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Pity you didn’t remain with them longer,” Dalinar said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ha! Well, I didn’t think it wise to stay around. After all, they were cannibals.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar shook his head, focusing back on the task at hand. “Wit says we <span aria-label="637" id="pg_637" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>have to somehow persuade Odium we’re a threat. But <i class="calibre6">I</i> think the enemy is manipulating us. This entire trick with Taravangian has me unsettled. We’re dealing with a god, but we aren’t using all the tools at our disposal.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He held up his palm. “With this, I can touch his world, the Spiritual Realm. And when I was fighting Nalan, I felt something, saw something. What if I could reforge the Oathpact? If the Fused stopped being reborn, would that not give us—at last—an edge over Odium? Something to <i class="calibre6">force</i> him to negotiate on our terms?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah folded her arms, pensive. Wit, however, leaned in. “You know,” Wit whispered, “I think he might be right. I feel ashamed to admit it, but the Blackthorn has seen further than we have, Jasnah. He is more valuable as a Bondsmith than as a general—or even a king.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You make a good argument, Uncle,” Jasnah admitted. “I’m simply worried. If your powers are so incredible, it feels dangerous to experiment with them. My own first forays into Soulcasting were deadly at times. What will your greater abilities do, by accident, in similar situations?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">It was a valid point, one that left them solemn as they picked up cups of wine and drank in silence, thinking. As they stood there, Prince Kmakl passed by on his way out of the tent, listening as a scribe read him a draft of a letter to the merchant lords of Thaylen City.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Another topic, Uncle,” Jasnah noted. “Lately, I see your eyes narrow when you look at Prince Kmakl. I thought you liked Fen and her husband.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I do like them,” he said. “I just don’t like how much bureaucracy Fen has to go through before anything gets done. The Azish are even worse. Why name your ruler an ‘emperor’ if he has to get approval from a dozen different functionaries to do his job?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“One is a constitutional monarchy, the other a scholarly republic,” Jasnah said, sounding amused. “What did you expect?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A king to be a king,” he muttered, drinking the rest of his wine in one gulp.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Both of their governments go back centuries,” Jasnah said. “They’ve had generations to refine their processes. We’d do well to learn from them.” She eyed him, thoughtful. “The days of absolute power in one person’s hands will likely soon pass us by. I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m the last true Alethi monarch.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What would your father say, hearing you talk like that?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I suspect I could make him understand,” she said. “He was interested in his legacy. Building something that would span generations. His goals were laudable, but his methods … well, our kingdom has been difficult to maintain. A king ruling by the gauntlet and sword can easily see it slip away when he weakens. Compare this to the Azish system, where a bad Prime is unable to single-handedly ruin their government.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="638" id="pg_638" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“And a good one is unable to accomplish much,” Dalinar said, then held his hand up to forestall further argument. “I see what you’re saying. But I find nobility in the traditional way of rule.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Having read the histories, I believe the nobility you imagine is created from stories <i class="calibre6">about</i> the inhabitants of ancient days, but rarely possessed by said inhabitants. Those kings tended to live short, brutal lives. No matter. Once we win this war, I expect to have decades to persuade you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Kelek help him. Dalinar poured himself more orange wine.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I will think on what you said about your powers,” Jasnah said, “and I will see if I can offer any advice on how to proceed. For now, Uncle, know that I trust your judgment in this, and will help support the Mink if you take a smaller role in war planning. You are right, and I was wrong to question.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“One is never wrong to question,” Dalinar said. “You taught me that.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She patted his arm fondly, then walked off to turn her attention to the maps the Mink was marking up on the war table.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Wit lingered, smiling at Dalinar. “I agree with her,” he whispered. “And on the topic of monarchs, I will have you know that <i class="calibre6">I</i> find you to be an endearing despot. You’re so pleasant, I <i class="calibre6">almost</i> don’t find it horrifying that I’m living among a people willing to trust a single man with near-absolute power over the lives of hundreds of thousands—while completely ignoring proper checks and balances upon his potential greed, jealousy, or ambition.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Did you really have to come with us, Wit?” Dalinar asked. “I…” He trailed off. Then shook his head.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What?” Wit asked.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Never mind. Saying anything would provide you with more rocks to throw at me.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“And you’re supposed to be the dumb one,” Wit said, grinning. “When have I ever mocked you, though?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“All the time, Wit. You mock everyone.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Do I? Do I really? Hmmm…” He tapped his chin. “I’m gainfully employed as Queen’s Wit, and she expects me to provide only the best of mockery on her behalf. I need to be careful about simply giving it away. Who is going to buy the cow, and all that.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar frowned. “What is a cow?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Big, juicy, delicious. Wish I could still eat them. You don’t seem to have them around here, which I find amazing, as I’m sure there was one somewhere in Sadeas’s lineage. Paternal grandfather perhaps. Watch the highprinces. There’s almost certainly going to be a show.” He sauntered off to take his customary position near Jasnah.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Watch the highprinces? What did that mean? For the most part, they <span aria-label="639" id="pg_639" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>were becoming a useful lot. Aladar kept reinforcing Dalinar’s trust in him, and Dalinar had sent him to oversee the withdrawal in Alethkar. Hatham had fallen into line, and Dalinar had him watching the supply chain from Azimir. Bethab was proving quite useful as an ambassador stationed in Thaylen City—or, well, his wife was the useful one, but they were both proving helpful. Roion was dead with honors, his son carefully chosen to not make things difficult. Even <i class="calibre6">Sebarial</i> was relevant these days.</p>
<p class="fmtx">One highprince was currently with Dalinar in Emul. Ruthar. Dalinar focused on the brawny, bearded man. He was the worst of those left; he fancied himself a soldier, but had never worn a proper uniform in his life. Today he hovered near the far end of the bar, by the strong wines. At least he’d learned to stop contradicting Dalinar in front of the other monarchs.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar narrowed his eyes toward Jasnah, who was making a display of going over the battle plans with the Mink. <i class="calibre6">She’s putting on a show,</i> he thought, noting how she specifically called out details on the maps, suggesting troop arrangements. She did a fair job, though she was no general.</p>
<p class="fmtx">The Mink listened to her suggestions, but likely wouldn’t take many of them. He seemed to find her fascinating. Well, Jasnah was a rare gemstone for certain. Was her show for the Mink? No … this had to do with Ruthar, didn’t it?</p>
<p class="fmtx">Further musings were interrupted as a figure in blue entered the tent. Lyn the Windrunner wore her hair in a braid, though wisps had pulled free during her flight. She’d led the most recent scouting of Urithiru.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar waved her over, and noted Jasnah at the map table quieting and turning to listen as Lyn gave her report.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We met with the soldier the queen sent,” the Windrunner explained, saluting. “I myself tried to step through the invisible barrier and approach. I dropped to the snow like I’d taken a hit straight to the jaw. The soldier had to drag me out to the others.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Did you see my wife?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No, sir,” Lyn said. “But that hike … it looks brutal. Radiants can’t get within hundreds of yards of the tower, so this soldier has to march all the way back and forth along the ridges for hours to get to where he can send messages.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar rubbed his chin in thought. Navani’s messages seemed trustworthy, and she cautioned patience. But passcodes were not foolproof, and something about this just felt wrong. “What can you see from a distance? Anything?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“We had to use spyglasses,” Lyn said. “There weren’t as many people out as usual, but there were some Windrunners on the roof, and I think I made out Teft up there, and Isom the Lightweaver. They held up a big sign, with glyphs that we <i class="calibre6">think</i> read ‘patience’ and ‘progress.’”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="640" id="pg_640" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Dalinar nodded. “Thank you, Radiant. Go give a full report, with details, to Brightness Teshav, then get something to eat.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Thank you, sir,” she said. She started toward the exit.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Something nagged at Dalinar, however. That weight hadn’t <i class="calibre6">completely</i> eased. “Lyn?” he called.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Sir?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“The enemy has Lightweavers. Or at least something similar.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Yes, sir,” she said. “Though the only confirmed report we have of them is that incursion at the Thaylen vault a year ago.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">He resisted shooting a glance at Szeth—so quiet, so easy to forget—standing nearby, wearing the face of an Alethi man.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ask Companylord Sigzil to send another team of scouts later tonight,” Dalinar said. “I’ll infuse the traveling gemstones for another run. Have this new team watch the tower from a distance, hidden, then report anything suspicious they might see.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Wise suggestion, sir,” Lyn said, then bowed and retreated.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah nodded to him, then returned to her exaggerated discussion of the maps. Yes, she <i class="calibre6">was</i> acting a role here.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar glanced at Ruthar, whose face was steadily growing redder. Perhaps he’d had a few drinks too many while waiting for the monarchs to finish their planning, but plainly he did <i class="calibre6">not</i> like how Jasnah was blatantly interjecting herself into the war plans. It was a masculine art, and Ruthar had been forbidden from participating in the planning today.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Looking at him, it was hard not to agree with what Jasnah had said about Alethkar. Gavilar’s grand unification of the kingdom hadn’t lasted ten years past his death before essentially breaking into civil war. Alethi squabbling had ended up favoring men like Ruthar. Oily, belligerent, aggressive. The last representation of old Alethkar.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah was making herself into bait. And Ruthar bit. Hard.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Am I the only one seeing this?” Ruthar asked a little too loudly to his attendants. “I didn’t say anything when she was made queen. Other nations have queens. But are any of <i class="calibre6">them</i> in this room interrogating a general?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">One of his companions tried to calm him, but he brushed her off, shouting, “It’s a disgrace! Dalinar writing? He might as well put on a havah and start painting. We <i class="calibre6">deserve</i> the judgments of the Almighty, after giving the throne to a godless wh—” He stopped himself just in time, perhaps realizing how still the tent had grown.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar stepped forward to berate the man. There was nothing for it now but to—</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Wit,” Jasnah said, her voice cold.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Wit strode forward, his hands spread to the sides, as if stepping out from behind curtains to face an adoring crowd. “I see you’re envious of <span aria-label="641" id="pg_641" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>those more skilled in the masculine arts than you, Ruthar,” Wit said. “I agree, you could use lessons on how to be a man—but those in this room would teach lessons far too advanced. Let me call in a eunuch to instruct you, and once you’ve reached his level, we’ll talk further.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Harsher,” Jasnah said.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You speak of honor, Ruthar, though you’ve never known it,” Wit said, his voice rising. “You’ll never find it though. You see, I hid your honor in a place you could never find it: in the arms of someone who truly loves you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Wit,” Jasnah said. “<i class="calibre6">Harsher.</i>”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I’ve been speaking to your children, Ruthar,” Wit said. “No, this part isn’t a joke. Relis, Ivanar. Yes, I know them. I know a lot of things. Would you like to explain to the queen where Ivanar’s broken arm last month <i class="calibre6">truly</i> came from? Tell me, do you beat your children because you’re a sadist, or because you’re a coward and they are the only ones who won’t dare fight back? Or … oh, silly Wit. It’s both, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“How <i class="calibre6">dare</i> you!” Ruthar roared, shoving away the attendant who tried to control him. Angerspren rose around his feet, like pools of bubbling blood. “I demand trial by swords! Me versus you, stupid fool. Or me against your champion, if you’re too much of a coward to face me!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Trial by combat accepted,” Wit said lightly, undoing his belt and sliding free his sheathed sword. “Shall we?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Fine!” Ruthar said, drawing his sword, causing many of the women and attendants to scatter to the sides of the large tent.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“This is idiocy,” Dalinar said, stepping between them. “Ruthar, you’ve been baited. Killing a Queen’s Wit is punishable by exile and forfeit of title. You <i class="calibre6">know</i> this.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Ruthar grunted, the words sinking in.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Besides,” Dalinar said, glancing over his shoulder, “that man is no simple Wit. I’m not sure if you <i class="calibre6">can</i> kill him.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You tell me I’d forfeit my title,” Ruthar growled. “What title? What <i class="calibre6">lands</i> do I hold? And exile? We are <i class="calibre6">in</i> exile, Blackthorn. Maybe I should challenge you. You’ve lost our kingdom, and now you expect me to waste my time in foreign lands? Protecting those we should have conquered? We <i class="calibre6">would</i> have, if your nephew had been half the man his father was.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ruthar,” Wit said, “you don’t need to fight him. Or me. I accept your challenge, but I exercise my right to choose a champion. You won’t risk losing your lands by killing a Wit.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Excellent,” Ruthar said. “I accept. Stop trying to interfere, Blackthorn.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar reluctantly stepped to the side. He felt a mounting dread, but there was nothing illegal here. And he doubted any action he could take would prevent this trap from springing.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“So,” Ruthar said, brandishing his sword. “Wit. You call <i class="calibre6">me</i> coward, <span aria-label="642" id="pg_642" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>then wiggle out of a challenge? So be it! Who do you want me to kill, then?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Your Majesty?” Wit said. “If you don’t mind?” He cocked his sheathed sword to the side, hilt out, as Jasnah brushed past and drew the weapon—a thin, silvery blade that Dalinar didn’t think he’d ever seen unsheathed.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar’s dread deepened as Jasnah stepped into striking range, batting aside Ruthar’s sword. He recovered from his shock and blocked her next strike. She was better than Dalinar might have expected, but her stance was uncertain, and she overreached. At best, she was equal to a promising student.</p>
<p class="fmtx">She had two distinct advantages though. She was Radiant. And Ruthar was an idiot.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I refuse this,” he said, tossing his sword aside. “I will not face a woman in combat. It is demeaning.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">And so, Jasnah stabbed him straight through the throat.</p>
<p class="fmtx">This lunge was better than the previous one, but it was not her skill that won the fight—it was the fact that Ruthar underestimated how far she would go. Indeed, Ruthar’s eyes bulged as shockspren shattered around him as yellow glass. He stumbled back, gushing lifeblood across his beautiful doublet.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Renarin!” Jasnah called.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar’s younger son scrambled into the tent from outside, and the full level of her preparation became manifest. The twisting feeling in Dalinar’s stomach began to release. He’d been preparing to lock down the tent, send guards for Ruthar’s next of kin, and institute martial law.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Renarin scurried forward and used his powers as a Truthwatcher to heal Ruthar, sealing up the wound in the man’s neck before he bled out. Still, Dalinar caught the eye of Fisk, the current captain of the Cobalt Guard. He was a solid fellow, bearer of the Blade Loremaker. Fisk nodded in understanding, and covertly signaled his soldiers to create a perimeter around the tent—nobody in or out—until Dalinar was ready to let news of this incident spread.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah held Wit’s sword out to her side, and he took it, clicking his tongue. “Not willing to wipe the blood off first, Brightness? I suppose this is the sword’s first kill. Adonalsium knows, I could never give her that myself. Still.” He wiped the weapon clean with a white handkerchief, glancing at Ruthar. “I’ll be billing you for a new handkerchief.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Both Wit and Jasnah pointedly ignored the horrified expressions of the room’s attendants. The standout exception was the Mink, who was grinning at the show. Dalinar almost expected him to begin applauding.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar felt no such mirth. Although she hadn’t gone all the way, he didn’t like Jasnah’s statement. Duels of passion were—if not common—an <span aria-label="643" id="pg_643" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>accepted part of Alethi culture. He himself had killed more than one man at a feast or other gathering. It was reminiscent, however, of their barbaric days as broken princedoms. Times that the Alethi tried to pretend had never happened. These days, this sort of thing was supposed to be handled in a more civilized way, with formal challenges and duels in arenas days later.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Ruthar,” Jasnah said, standing above him. “You have insulted me thrice tonight. First, by implying a queen should not take concern for the welfare of her own armies. Second, by threatening to assault my Wit, a man who is an extension of the royal will. Third and worst of all, by judging me unfit to defend myself, despite my calling as a Knight Radiant.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“As you have died tonight, and I have bested you legally in combat, I name you forfeit of your title. It will pass to your eldest son, who has been speaking quite frankly with Wit recently. It seems he will make a far more fitting highprince.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That bastard!” Ruthar croaked. “That traitorous bastard!”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Not yours then, is he?” Wit said. “That explains why I like him.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“What you do from here is your choice,” Jasnah said. “Unfortunately, by the time you leave this tent, you will find that your princedom has quite thoroughly moved on. You’ll be barred entrance to your own camp, should you try to return. I suggest you join the military as a new recruit. Alternatively, you may take up the queen’s charity at the Beggars’ Feasts and poorhouses.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She left him gaping on the floor and touching his healed neck—still wet with blood. Renarin awkwardly hurried after Jasnah as she moved over to the map table.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Wit dropped his bloody handkerchief before Ruthar. “How remarkable,” he said. “If you spend your life knocking people down, you eventually find they won’t stand up for you. There’s poetry in that, don’t you think, you storming personification of a cancerous anal discharge?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar marched up beside Jasnah at the table. Szeth stayed close behind him, carefully watching Ruthar, silent but making certain Dalinar’s back was guarded. Renarin stood with his hands in his pockets and refused to meet Dalinar’s gaze. The boy likely felt guilty for keeping this little plan quiet, though Dalinar wasn’t angry at him. Denying Jasnah was next to impossible in situations like this.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Don’t glare at me, Uncle,” Jasnah said softly. “It was a lesson I had to give. Ruthar was a mouthpiece for many other discontented grumblings.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I had assumed,” he said, “that you of all people would wish to teach your lessons <i class="calibre6">without</i> a sword.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“I would much prefer it,” she said. “But you cannot tame a feral axehound with kind words. You use raw meat.”</p>
<p class="fmtx"><span aria-label="644" id="pg_644" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>She eyed the still-stunned people in the tent. They were all quite deliberately staying away from Ruthar. Dalinar met Fisk’s eyes, then nodded again. The lockdown could be eased. Ruthar’s closest allies were fickle, and would see his fallen state as a disease to be avoided. Jasnah had already secured the loyalty of those who could have been dangerous—his family and military advisors.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“You should know,” Dalinar said, “that I found this entire experience distasteful. And not only because you didn’t warn me it was going to happen.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“That is <i class="calibre6">why</i> I didn’t warn you,” Jasnah said. “Here. This may calm you.” She tapped a paper she’d set onto the map table, which the Mink picked up and began reading with great interest. He looked like he hadn’t been so entertained in years.</p>
<p class="fmtx">“A draft of a new law,” the short man said. “Forbidding trial by sword. How unexciting.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Jasnah plucked the paper from his fingers. “I will use my own <i class="calibre6">unfortunate</i> experience today as an example of why this is a terrible tradition. Ruthar’s blood will be the last such spilled. And as we leave this era of barbarism, each and every attendant at court will know that Alethkar’s first queen is a woman unafraid of doing what needs to be done. Herself.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">She was firm, so Dalinar tucked away his anger, then turned to leave. A part of him understood her move, and it <i class="calibre6">was</i> likely to be effective. Yet at the same time, it displayed that Jasnah Kholin—brilliant, determined—was not perfect. There were things about her that unnerved even the callous soldier that lived deep inside him.</p>
<p class="fmtx">As he walked away, Renarin hurried over. “Sorry,” the boy whispered. “I didn’t know she hadn’t told you.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“It’s all right, son,” Dalinar said. “I suspect that without you, she’d have gone through with the plan anyway—then left him to bleed out on the floor.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Renarin ducked his head. “Father. I’ve … had an episode.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Dalinar stopped. “Anything urgent?”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“No.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">“Can I find you later today, maybe tomorrow?” Dalinar asked. “I want to help contain the fallout from this stunt.”</p>
<p class="fmtx">Renarin nodded quickly, then slipped out of the tent. Ruthar had stumbled to his feet, holding his neck, his gaudy yellow outfit now ruined. He searched around the room as if for succor, but his former friends and attendants were quietly slipping away—leaving only soldiers and the queen, who stood with her back to him. As if Ruthar were no longer worth attention.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Wit stood in his jet-black suit, one hand on the map table, leaning at a nearly impossible angle. Dalinar often found Wit with a grin on his face, <span aria-label="645" id="pg_645" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>but not today. Today the man looked cold, emotionless. His eyes were deep voids, their color invisible in the dim light.</p>
<p class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">They maneuvered Ruthar expertly,</i> Dalinar thought. <i class="calibre6">Forced him to make all the wrong moves. Could … I do something similar in facing Odium?</i> Anger the god somehow, forcing him to accept a reckless agreement?</p>
<p class="fmtx">How did one intimidate a creature as powerful as Odium? What, on all of Roshar, could a god possibly fear or hate so much? He’d have to bring up the matter with Jasnah and Wit. Though … not today.</p>
<p class="fmtx">Today he’d had enough of their machinations.</p>
